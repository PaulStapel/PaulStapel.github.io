I like the taste of paella, but it can be a bit of a hassle to get right. I wanted to make a dish that scratches that paella itch without having it be an actual paella. This is the result. 

## Ingredients
- Chicken breast (If it's too thick, cut it in half crosswise)
- Lemon
- Chicken stock
- Coriander leafs (fresh or dried)
- Parsley (fresh or dried)
- Rice
- Cooking oil

### Spice mix
- 2 tsp paprika powder
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/4 tsp dried oregano
- 1/4 tsp tumeric powder (optional)
- 1/4 tsp dried parsley (optional)

## Cooking plan
- Put about half of your spice mix on your chicken, and rub in some of your cooking oil. 
- In a cast iron pan, heat up some cooking oil and cook your chicken through. Make sure it is nice and browned on both sides. By making the chicken breasts a bit thin, you can keep it juicy while cooking it through fully. 
- Once the chicken is done put your rice in the pan. Cover it in a liquid of chicken stock, half a lemon and the rest of your spice mix. Use about 500 ml for a cup of rice. Cook until the rice water is gone and the rice is soft. 
- Finally, add your chicken and some of the left-over oil back to your pan. Garnish with parsley and coriander and the remaining juice of your lemon. 

## ENJOY!!
