Ok, so I've got another Indian recipe I'd like to share with y'all. This is a dish that I did not understand for quite a while, and looking at recipes online, it seemed a little bland to me. Turns out this was all just a skill-issue, as I did not quite understand Indian food at that time. Knowing what I know now, I'd like to share an actually tasty recipe for aloo keema. I like serving this with naan, rice and my [mint dip](https://paulstapel.com/recipes/mint-dip/).

## Ingredients
- Ground pork (or ground mutton, but this is harder to find in the Netherlands)
- Potatoes
- Red onions
- Green chilis
- Tomato (cubed, but tomato passata also works)
- Ginger
- Garlic
- Cinnamon (stick or powder)
- Cardamom (pods or ground)
- Bay leaf
- Cloves (whole or powder)
- Tumeric powder
- Coriander powder
- Chili powder
- Cumin powder
- Garam masala powder
- Salt
- Coriander leafs (to garnish)
- A pinch of salt

## Cooking plan
- Start by heating oil in a pan and tempering your Cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf and cloves. 
- Once your spices are tempered, add your onions and let them brown on medium heat. After a bit, also slit your green chilis and add them. 
- Mince your garlic and ginger and add them once your onions are done. Then, add your tomatoes to the pot, until these are done and a little mushy. 
- Now, add your Tumeric powder, coriander powder, chili powder, cumin powder, and garam masala in a 1:2:4:2:1 ratio. Then season the rest with salt. 
- Add in your meat and cook it on medium-high heat until it is browned. 
- Add in your potatoes and cover your Keema in water, cook until your potatoes are fork-tender. 
- Finally, garnish with coriander leafs. 

## ENJOY!!
