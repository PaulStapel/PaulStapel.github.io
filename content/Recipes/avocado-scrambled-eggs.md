As I am starting to excercise more, it becomes more and more important that I maintain a healthy diet. This means that my caloric intake has to increase a little, and that I need some more protein in my diet. In order to facillitate this, I will be looking into some recipes utilising eggs. This is my first creation in that regard. 

## Ingredients
- Toast or other crispy bread
- Butter
- Avocado
- Eggs
- Salt and pepper
- Lao Gan Ma (If you don't have it or wan't more spice, you can also use something like sambal) 

## Cooking plan
- Start by adding butter to a pan. 
- If you want to toast your bread, put your butter in a pan on medium-high heat and start toasting the bread until it is nice and browned on both sides. Otherwise, slice open your bread. 
- Whisk some eggs, seasoned with salt and pepper, and cook them in your buttered pan. Scramble them by stiring continuously (I use chopsticks for this, but a whisk can also work if your pan is non-stick). 
- You can choose to either slice your avocado or to mash it. Whatever you choose, spread it onto your bread. 
- Next, add your scrambled eggs. 
- Top it off with some little drizzles of Lao Gan Ma to taste. I just spread it onto the toast with a spoon. 

## ENJOY!!
