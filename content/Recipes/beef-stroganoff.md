All jokes aside, this recipe results in a rich and creamy beef stroganoff. As pork is a lot cheaper where I live, I often use pork as instead of beef. This is still very tasty, but if you can, try making it with beef, as it will be even richer in flavor. You should serve it with pasta. I recommend serving this with pasta like tagliatelle, but mashed potatoes would also be verrryyy good I imagine. Without further ado, let's get into this recipe :D

## Ingredients
- Beef (pork)
- Cooking oil
- Mushrooms
- Butter
- White onion
- Sour cream (can also use cremé fraîche)
- Dijon mustard
- Flour
- Salt and pepper
- Beef stock

## Cooking plan
- Start by chopping your beef / pork into small strips. Put some salt and pepper on that meat.  
- Heat a pot with cooking oil and cook your meat until browned. It should stick a little to the bottom, and you don't really have to worry about it still being a little pink in some places. Just make sure that it has some nice brown spots on it. 
- Lower your heat a bit and add a bunch of butter to your pot. 
- Next, cook your chopped onions untill browned. After that, add chopped mushrooms as well. Let this cook until the mushrooms are browned. 
- Next, add flour to the pan. This will help in thickening your sauce eventually. The reason for adding it before adding our liquid is explained in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/w4miyy/gravy_flour_before_or_after_stockwater/).
- After that, add your beef stock. Let this simmer on medium heat and eventually add your mustard and sour cream to taste. You want to let it simmer until it has become creamy, and the sour cream will help achieve this (it's in the name really...)

## ENJOY!
