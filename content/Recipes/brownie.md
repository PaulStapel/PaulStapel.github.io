I don't bake often, but from time to time, I really enjoy filling my pantry with some sweet deliciousness. This brownie recipe is one of my favs when it comes to that purpose. You can store this brownie for later, but even better would be to scoop them right out of the pan and eat it while it's hot. 

## Ingredients
- 220 grams sugar
- 120 grams butter
- 80 grams all-purpose flower
- 3 or 4 eggs (3 if you want it fudgy, 4 if you like them more solid)
- 60 grams cacao powder
- A little bit of salt
- Optional vanilla extract
- Optional chocalate chips or chunks
- Optional whipped cream for serving

## Baking plan
- Start by heating an oven to about 180 degrees Celcius. 
- Start by melting the butter in a heated skillet.  
- When the butter is melted, add your sugar, mix it well. 
- Once mixed, add your cacao powder and stir it through. 
- Once this has been stirred, you may add some optional vanilla extract. half a teaspoon will do. 
- After this, turn of the heat and stir your eggs through the brownie mixture. 
- Next, add your flour and stir it until the mixture has turned brown. 
- Finally, you may add your optional chocalate chips to the mixture however you may like. 
- Put the pan in the oven for about 20 (for gooey brownies) to 25 (for more firm brownies) minutes. 

## ENJOY!
