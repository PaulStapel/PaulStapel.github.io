Historically, the Dutch have had close ties with the Indonesians starting way back with the VOC. One product of these ties is the introduction of the Bumbu Kacang, or "Pindasaus" to the dutch kitchen. Although we Dutch people have our own view on how we should prepare this sauce, I like to stick a bit more with the Indonesian traditions. This is my recipe for a Bumbu Kacang. 

## Ingredients
- Peanut butter (chunky, smooth is also fine) (3 tbsp)
- Dark soy sauce (1 tbsp)
- Coconut milk (220 milliliters)
- Fish sauce (1 tbsp)
- Chili oil (1 tbsp)
- Lime juice (2 tbsp)
- Palm sugar (1 tbsp)
- Ground coriander (1/2 tsp)
- Salt (1/2 tsp)

## Cooking plan
- Add all ingredients to a pan and let it cook on medium heat until it has reached the desired consistency

## ENJOY!!
