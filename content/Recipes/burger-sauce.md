Today, I share a very simple recipe for a burger sauce. It's easy to make and a lot more interesting than your usual mayonaise or ketchup that you put on your burger. When making burgers, I suggest you assemble the following: your buns, a leave of lettuce, some fried onions, gherkins/pickles, your patty and lastly this burger sauce. 

## Ingredients
- Mayonaise (250 grams)
- Mustard (30 grams)
- 1 tbsp of white vinegar
- 0.5 tbsp of apple vinegar (or just a little more white vinegar)
- 1 tsp of garlic powder
- 1 tsp of onion powder
- 1 tsp of smoked paprika powder

## Cooking plan
- Literally just throw everything into a bowl, mix it, and finally let it cool for about 1 hour (or as long as possible if you need it sooner). 

## ENJOY!
