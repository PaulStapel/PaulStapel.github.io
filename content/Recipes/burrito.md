A good burrito recipe has been like the holy grail for me. I looove burritos, but I just wasn't able to get them to taste quite right. This recipe is finally close to the taste I have been searching for. 

## Ingredients

- Ground beef
- White onion
- Vegetable or olive oil. 
- Lots of beans. I use kidney beans. They will be pasted. 
- About 2 parts Salt, 1 part Pepper, 1 part Garlic powder, 4 parts Paprika powder, 8 parts Cumin. This will be your seasoning. 
- Optionally, you may add vegetables like bell pepper, carrots, leek or whatever you think will taste good. I like the extra variation each bite brings when you add some vegetables to this dish.
- Water or beef stock (be careful with the salt content!).   

### Serve with
- Shredded cheese
- Sour cream
- Guacamole
- White or brown rice
- Tortillas
- Jalape√±os
- Optionally, tortilla chips. 

## Cooking plan
- Coat your pan lightly with oil and start browning the beef. 
- While this is happening, blend your beans until they form a bean paste. 
- Once the beef has been browned, remove it from your pan and start sweating your onions until translucent. 
- Now, add your optional vegetables and wait until they are done. 
- Add back your ground beef and add your bean paste. Also add in your seasoning. 
- Add some water or beef stock to deglaze your pan and let the water content reduce until the burrito filling has your desired texture. It should be thick and a little runny, but not watery. 
- Assemble your delicious burrito(s).

## ENJOY!
