So today, I tried to do something new with pork belly. Most of my recipes involving this ingredient are Chinese, and so I thought I'd spice things up a little by taking some more inspiration from the french kitchen. Be warned, this recipe is quite fatty, but otherwise it's very easy to make and nutritious to boot.

## Ingredients
- Butter
- Dried oregano
- Salt and Pepper
- Pork belly
- Lemon
- White onion
- Garlic
- Water
- Dark soy sauce (for color)
- Ginger (or ginger powder)
- High smoking point oil
- Serve with white rice. 

## Cooking plan
- First, slice your pork belly into bite sized pieces and cover with a little salt, pepper and dried oregano. 
- Add some oil and 2 thin slices of butter to a heated pan. 
- When the butter has melted, add your pork belly to a pan and let it crisp properly. 
- In a sauce pan, add 2 thin slices of butter, a little bit of oil and your garlic. Stir it until it is fragrant and sauteed. 
- Once the pork is done, remove it from your pan and add onion (in rings or slices), leave it to brown a little while you further prepare your sauce. 
- To your sauce, add the ginger, lemon and more dried oregano. After that, add a little water and dark soy sauce for coloring. Reduce the sauce until it is thick (perhaps with some cornstarch added to quicken the process). 
- Add the sauce, pork and onion into your pan and stir a little until everything is covered. 

## ENJOY!
