So, yesterday I was craving some good 'ol spaghetti. I usually go with a tomato sauce, but this time, I saw that I still had some parmigiano in my fridge. I simply couldn't resist the urge to try something new, and ended up making this delicious carbonara. It may not be the healthiest, but it was definitely worth it in the end. I included a secret ingredient of miso paste in order to boost the umami content. Although I strongly recommend you put it, the dish will still turn out yummy if omitted.

## Ingredients
- (Cubed) bacon
- Spaghetti
- Eggs
- Miso paste
- Parmigiano reggiano
- Olive oil
- Salt and pepper

## Cooking plan
- Salt a pan of water and bring it to a boil.
- Put your spaghetti into the pan and let it cook until it has the desired doneness.
- In a bowl, first add your eggs. Add 1 egg yolk for every 2 eggs you put in to make the sauce more silky and smooth.
- Add 1 to 2 scoops of miso paste to this egg mixture, and top it off with a very generous amount of parmigiano. The sauce should contain a lot of cheese. At the end, also add a generous amount of pepper. 
- Start cooking your bacon in the pan until nice and browned. The pan will be deglazed later on when you add your pasta(water). 
- When the pasta is done, add it to your pan and add some of your residual pasta water. Next, take your pan off the heat.
- Finally, add your sauce. The hot pasta water will make sure that your sauce will cook without having to stir it too much (which would scramble your eggs, yikes), and the starch from the pasta water also helps thicken the sauce. Gently stir the sauce over your spaghetti to cover everything. 

## ENJOY!
