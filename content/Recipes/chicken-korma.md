I am always delighted when I try a new Indian recipe, and today was no different. I have eaten quite some Korma during my last trip to Singapore, and now I am happy to announce that I have managed to bring this flavor home. Enjoy this korma with white rice or naan. 

## Ingredients

### Marinade
- Chicken (bone-in)
- Garam masala
- Greek yoghurt (any fatty yoghurt will do)
- Paprika powder
- Kurkuma/tumeric powder
- Ginger (fresh or alternatively ground)
- Garlic (fresh or alternatively ground)
- Salt

### Curry
- Ghee (or cooking oil)
- Greek yoghurt
- Ground cardemom
- Garam Masala
- White onion (We will caramelise, but for a more traditional flavor, deep fry the onion)
- Cashew nuts (for extra creaminess, normally tomatoes are added, but I prefer cashew nuts)
- Green (or red) chilis
- Cinnamon (stick, or ground)
- Cloves (whole or ground)
- Nutmeg (grated or ground)
- Coriander powder
- Fresh coriander leafs and/or mint leafs (or dried works fine as well)
- Bay leaf (optional)
- Mace (optional, but traditional)

## Cooking plan
- Start by marinating the chicken with all of the ingredients. Let it sit for about half an hour, or longer if time permits. 
- In a pan, heat up some ghee or oil and add some of your cardemom, until fragrant. Meanwhile, chop up your white onion into small chunks. 
- Add your white onion into the pan and let it caramelise (or at least brown) on medium heat. Add a pinch of salt to speed up this process, as this will draw out the moisture. Near the end of the process, add your cashew nuts and chili pepper. 
- Put everything in this pan inside of a blender, along with enough yoghurt to cover it all. This will be a paste to add creaminess and flavor to your curry. 
- Add some more ghee or oil to your pan and start by toasting your cinnamon, cloves, bay leaf, mace and some more cardemom. 
- Once they are fragrant, add your chicken to the pan and let it cook on medium-high heat until it is (almost) cooked through. 
- Next, add back your blended paste along with some hot water and season with garam masala and ground coriander. 
- Finally, season to taste with some salt, garam masala, nutmeg and ground cloves (be careful with the amount you add!)  
- Garnish with fresh koriander leafs and/or mint leafs, and serve with white rice or naan. 

## ENJOY!!
