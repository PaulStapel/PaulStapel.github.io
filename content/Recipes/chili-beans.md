For this dish, I was inspired by a recipe from a book I was recently given (One Piece: Pirate Recipes xD). It is a very simple recipe, and I wished to expand upon it to make it even tastier. 

## Ingredients
- Kidney beans
- Ground beef (or pork, or mixed)
- Garlic
- Onion
- Ground cayenne pepper
- Paprika powder
- Tomato paste 
- Diced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- Salt
- Cooking oil 

## Cooking plan
- Start by seasoning your ground beef with ground cayenne pepper, salt and paprika powder. 
- To a pan add some cooking oil and brown your ground beef. 
- Meanwhile, start mincing your onion and garlic. Once your ground beef is done, remove it from your pan and add the onion. After it has turned translucent, add your garlic. 
- Add some tomato paste to your pan, along with the diced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Stir and let it deepen its color a little before adding some water and your kidney beans.
- Let the beans simmer for a bit until most of the water has evaporated. Finally, add back in your ground beef and season to taste with your spices. 
- This recipe pairs well with nachos, tortillas or rice for example. 

## ENJOY!!
