I want to make my Indian recipes a bit more accessible for weekday dinners, so to start, I have contrived this nice little recipe for an Indian coconut chicken curry. 

## Ingredients
- Neutral cooking oil (1 - 2 tbsp)
- Chicken (thighs taste best, but breasts also work) (500 grams)
- White onion (1 piece) 
- Garlic (5 cloves)
- Ginger (small-medium piece)
- [Indian curry spices](https://paulstapel.com/recipes/indian-spice-mix/) (2 - 3 tbsp, or more to taste)
- Salt (to taste)
- Sugar (about 1 tsp or to taste)
- Coconut milk (300 - 400 ml)
- Chicken stock (Just about half a cup to deglaze your pan and add some extra flavor)
- Parmesan rind (optional, for extra taste)
- Koriander (fresh, or dried) (1.5 tbsp)


## Cooking plan
- Cut your chicken into bite-sized pieces. Heat some cooking oil in a pan and brown your chicken. Once it has browned, put it aside on a seperate plate. 
- Mince your white onion, garlic and ginger. Starting saut√©ing your onion. Once translucent, add your ginger and garlic. 
- Once done, add your chicken back into the pan, and season with salt, sugar and spices. 
- Deglaze your pan with chicken stock and mop up the browned bits. Then, add your coconut milk (and optional parmesan rind) and let it simmer for about 15 minutes on medium heat. 
- Add your koriander and reduce your curry until it has the desired thickness. 
- Serve with white rice or naan. 

## ENJOY!!
