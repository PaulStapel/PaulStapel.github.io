Yep, another keema recipe. Ground beef is cheap here in the Netherlands, and I always like to try interesting ways to spice up such a simple base. This is a go-to for when I crave some quick coconutty flavors. 

## Ingredients
- Ground beef
- Vegetable oil
- Garlic
- Ginger
- White onion
- Coconut milk
- Tomato paste
- Koriander (Cilantro) (optional)
- Lemongrass (optional, for more of a Thai kick to the dish)
- Lemon juice (optional)
- Garam masala (optional, for extra seasoning to taste)
- Spice mix (see below)

### Spice mix
- 2 tbsp coriander powder
- 1 tbsp turmeric powder
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 1 tbsp paprika powder
- 1 tbsp cumin powder
- 1/2 tsp ginger powder
- 1/2 tsp Cinnamon powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp clove powder
- 1/2 tsp cardamom powder
- 1/2 tsp ground pepper
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Cooking plan
- Heat some vegetable oil in a pan on high heat and brown your ground beef until the water contents have evaporated. 
- Chop up your aromatic vegetables (garlic, ginger, white onion, optional lemongrass) and add them to the pan. Optionally, you may want to give more attention to these veggies by removing the beef from the pan, but if you're in a hurry, you can keep it all in the same pan. 
- Add your tomato paste and let it cook for a bit to remove the water contents. 
- Next, add your spice mix, stir a bit and then add your beef back to the pan. 
- Add coconut milk until most of the beef is covered, and then let it simmer and reduce until the beef has become creamy and thick. 
- Season with garam masala, koriander and lemon juice to taste. 

## ENJOY!!
