This is one of my favorite sauces to pair with something like an entrecôte steak. It is also perfect for hamburgers and sausages. It becomes even better if you first cook your meat using this butter. 

## Ingredients
- Butter
- Garlic
- Mustard
- Lemon juice
- Parsley
- Thyme
- Cayenne pepper powder
- Smoked paprika powder
- Salt
- A bunch of black pepper
- Chives (optional)
- Chili flakes (optional)

## Cooking plan

## ENJOY!
