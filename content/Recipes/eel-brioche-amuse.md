My friend Levi and I usually like to cook when we meet up. He is active in the culinary world as a host, and before that he has also worked in the kitchen for a while. It helps that we both have a soft spot for good food :). Last week, he surpised me with an amuse that he had devised himself. It was light yet incredibly tasty, and for how easy it was to make, it left a fancy impression. To honor him, I'd like to share this recipe on my blog. 

## Ingredients
- Eel
- Brioche
- Butter
- Chives
- Kewpie mayo or Kewpie wasabi mayo (We made both kinds)

## Cooking plan
- Start by cutting the brioche into semi-thick slices and quartering those slices (or even eighting them depending on how large you want your amuse to be). 
- Use these slices of brioche to measure the amount of eel that would fit on each slice and cut the eel into portions. 
- In a pan, melt some butter on medium-high heat. 
- When the pan is hot, start placing your pieces of brioche into the pan and browning each of the 6 sides evenly. 
- Once done, take them out of your pan and arange them on a plank or serving plate. 
- Top your brioche with a layer of your mayo, and then place your eel on top. 
- Finally, finely chop some chives and sprinkle them on to garnish. 

## ENJOY!!
