Today, we will be making OE. I'll let you figure out what that means. 

## Ingredients

- Onions
- Eggs
- (also some pepper, salt and cooking oil)

## Cooking plan
- We will be using about one onion per one egg. 
- For people that like the taste of onion, I suggest you let the onions sweat by using a medium-low heat, until the onions turn translucent. This takes about 10 minutes. 
- For those of you that have time on their hands, let the onions caramelise on the same medium-low heat. This takes an additional 30 to 40 minutes, until they have turned brown and crisp. 
- Add in the eggs and stir on a high heat, untill you have the consistency of scrambled eggs. 
- Finally, add pepper and salt to taste. 

## ENJOY!!
