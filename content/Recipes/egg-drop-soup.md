I've started getting into making soup recently. This is new territory for me, but I decided to give it a try after pondering what to do with the leftover chinese cabbage that had been living rent-free in my fridge for a too long. Behold! This soup was the result. 

## Ingredients:

- Chinese Cabbage
- About 1 liter of chicken stock
- Eggs (about 3)
- White onion (can be omitted)
- Garlic
- Sesame oil
- Powdered or grated ginger 
- Salt and (preferably white) pepper
- Scallion 
- A little bit of cooking oil

## Cooking plan: 

- Chop up your onions, garlic and scallion (put aside the green for garnish). 
- In a deep pot, start sweating the onion and scallion in a little bit of oil. After a few minutes, add the garlic as well. 
- Meanwhile, start tearing the cabbage apart with your hands. Doing it this way gives you nice and irregular pieces, which is nicer for the texture than when the cabbage is chopped.
- Add the chicken stock and add ginger, sesame oil, salt and pepper to taste. If you're not sure, you can also add these ingredients after the next step, but I have found this to be less tasty. 
- Add in the cabbage, and cover the pot with a lid. Leave it be for about 10 minutes, untill the cabbage has wilted. 
- Finally, beat your eggs in a bowl. While stiring with one hand, slowly drizzle in the egg. This creates the signature egg ribbons associated with this dish. Let it rest for a few minutes and you're ready to serve!

## ENJOY!
