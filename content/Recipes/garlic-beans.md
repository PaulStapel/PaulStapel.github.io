### Ingredients:

* Green beans
* Garlic
* Ginger
* Soy Sauce
* Oil with a high smoking point (vegetable, peanut, etc.)

### Cooking plan: 

* First, fry the beans in the oil till they become shriveled and you begin to see some yellow. 
* Next, in a new pan, heat up the garlic, ginger and soy sauce. Go easy on the soy sauce. 
* Finally, add the beans back in and mix them with the sauce.

### ENJOY!
