The only way to make a good dish even gooder is to add an exuberant amount of garlic to it. That was exactly the premise of this little experiment. Adding a lot of garlic and seeing where it leads me. It turned out to be a delightful recipe that I have even decided to share her on my blog. Be warned, not for the faint of heart. 

## Ingredients
- Lots of garlic (I used about 2 bulbs, but adjust to your own tolerance/taste)
- Noodles
- Onion
- Zucchini
- Ground beef or meatballs
- Chili oil (I use Lao Gan Ma)
- A little vegetable oil
- Light soy sauce
- Optional black bean sauce

## Cooking plan
- To a pot, add some salted water and cook your noodles as per the instructions on the package. 
- Next, mince the onion and cut up the zucchini into small pieces. If you're not using a garlic press, mince your garlic. 
- Add some vegetable oil to your pan and start by sweating the onions. After they are translucent, turn up the heat and add your zucchini and chili oil. Lastly, add your garlic (using a garlic press). 
- At this point, you may add your meat. I used meatballs (cursed, I know), but ground beef also works great. Be sure to stir often, as otherwise your aromatics may burn. 
- When your sauce has browned, add light soy sauce and optional black bean sauce to taste. I used a ratio of 3:1 for these ingredients. You can also add some more Lao Gan Ma if you want. 
- Lastly, toss your noodles into your pan and stir carefully until it is covered in sauce. 

## ENJOY!
