This is my first Korean recipe on this blog (cool). When I was out grocery shopping, I stumbled upon Gochujang, and it looked so good that i decided I simply HAD to make something with it. This is the result. Serve with rice.  

## Ingredients

- Gochujang
- Chicken breasts
- Cornstarch
- Spring onion
- White onion
- Garlic
- Sugar
- Soy sauce
- Sesame oil
- Toasted sesame seeds (optional, garnish)
- Cooking oil

## Cooking plan
- Cut your chicken breasts into cubes. 
- Coat your chicken in a layer of cornstarch   
- In a seperate bowl, prepare your sauce by mixing sugar, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil and gochujang. 
- In a pan (or a wok if possible) stir fry your chicken breasts until it has become a bit crispy. Make sure to use a lot of oil, as otherwise the cornstarch will stick to the pan. 
- Chop your white onion into large chunks. 
- Once the chicken is crisp, remove some of the excess oil and add your spring onion and white onion. 
- Finally, add your sauce to the pan and stir it until it has the right consistency. 

## ENJOY!!
