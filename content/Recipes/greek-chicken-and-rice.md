Recently, I made a recipe for Spanish chicken and rice. Both family and peers seemed to really enjoy this recipe, and therefore I am creating a Greek twist. I recommend eating it with fresh bread and some [Tzatziki.](https://paulstapel.com/recipes/tzatziki/)

## Ingredients
- Chicken breast (If it's too thick, cut it in half crosswise)
- Lemon
- Chicken stock
- White vinegar (just a little will do, optional)
- Rice
- Cooking oil

### Spice mix
- 3/2 tsp dill
- 3 or 4 bay leafs, crushed
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried parsley
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp paprika powder
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder

## Cooking plan
- Pat your chicken dry with a (paper) towel and rub on a squeeze of (half a) lemon and vinegar. 
- Put about half of your spice mix on your chicken. 
- In a cast iron pan, heat up some cooking oil and cook your chicken through. Make sure it is nice and browned on both sides. By making the chicken breasts a bit thin, you can keep it juicy while cooking it through fully. 
- Once the chicken is done put your rice in the pan. Cover it in a liquid of chicken stock, (the remaining part of) half a lemon, a dash of vinegar and the rest of your spice mix. Use about 500 ml for a cup of rice. Cook until the rice water is gone and the rice is soft. 
- Finally, add your chicken and some of the left-over oil back to your pan. You may let it cook a bit more at this point, resulting in a more chewy and pot-sticking rice dish. It can also be served now, both are good. 

## ENJOY!!
