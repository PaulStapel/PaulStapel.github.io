I like Greek food, but with food prices nowadays, it can be a bit difficult to afford lamb or quality beef for these recipes. Luckily, you can still get all those lovely flavors of the Greek kitchen with just a few ingredients and ground beef. Let's get into it. 

## Ingredients
- Ground beef
- Olive oil
- Butter
- Cinnamon
- Nutmeg
- Thyme
- Basil
- Rosemary
- Oregano
- White onion
- Garlic
- Lime (optional)
- Feta cheese (optional)
- Yoghurt (optional)

## Cooking plan
- Start by adding olive oil and ground beef to a pan. Only add a little oil so as to help render out the fat of the beef. 
- Cook it through until it has become a little gray, then add minced onion and garlic. 
- Stir it through a bit until the onion becomes translucent, then add the butter. 
- Brown the ground beef until it has become very browned and almost crispy. Really be patient with this step, as it adds a lot of the depth of flavor.  
- Add your cinnamon, nutmeg, thume, basil, rosemary and oregano. Stir and add some water to deglaze the pan.
- Finally, add seasoning to taste. 
- Serve with pita, bread and garnish with some yoghurt, lime and feta cheese. 

## ENJOY!!
