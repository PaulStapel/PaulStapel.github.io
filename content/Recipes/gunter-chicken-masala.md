I have been making a lot of masala recently, and this gunter chicken masala was really tasty when I tried making it. I have made some adjustments to my first iteration, and I hope you enjoy cooking this! Do keep in mind, this dish is among the spiciest I've made so far, so reduce the amount of dried chili's if that is a problem. 

## Ingredients

### Masala powder
- About 4-5 dried chili's
- 2 tsp coriander seeds
- 1 tsp black peppercorns
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
To make the masala powder, first toast the whole spices and dried chili's whole, and put them in a spice blender. 

### Masala paste
- 2 tsp masala powder (that you just made)
- About 1 - 2 tsp minced ginger
- About 4-5 cloves of garlic
- A little water to make it a paste
We will use this masala paste to marinate the chicken. Again, mix all ingredients in a blender

### Marinade
- Chicken (bone-in)
- Tumeric powder
- Masala paste (that you just made)
- Garam masala (only a little)
- Kashmiri chili powder
- Some salt
- Yoghurt/lemon (yoghurt for more oily sauce, lemon for a bit of a drier curry)

### Curry
- Mustard seeds
- Cumin seeds
- Red onions
- Tomato passata
- Masala powder (that you just made)
- Vegetable oil
- Chopped koriander (for garnish, optional but recommended) 
- Cinnamon (to taste, for seasoning, optional but recommended)

## Cooking plan
- In a pan, add some oil and start by cooking the mustard seeds and cumin seeds until fragrant. 
- Next, add your red onions and stir for a while on medium-high heat, until they become a little browned and crispy. 
- In a food processor, blend the contents in your pan into a smooth paste. We will add this back later. 
- In your now cleared pan, start roasting the chicken on high heat. You want your chicken to be browned and almost cooked through. 
- Next, add your tomato passata into the pan, and stir back in your onion paste. 
- Season with your masala powder, some optional cinnamon (for a little bit of a sweeter note to balance the spicy flavors) and top with your chopped koriander 

## ENJOY!!
