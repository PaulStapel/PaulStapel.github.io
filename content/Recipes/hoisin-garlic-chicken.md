Some good chicken goes a long way. A classic chicken dish with a Chinese touch is Honey garlic chicken, and I decided to create my own take on this popular dish. The result is this Hoisin garlic chicken. 

## Ingredients
- Chicken breasts
- Flour
- Butter
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Garlic
- Ginger
- Soy sauce (dark)
- Hoisin sauce (sub with honey if not available for a more popular honey garlic chicken)
- Apple vinegar

## Cooking plan
- Start by seasoning your chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Make sure your chicken breasts are cut into relatively thin steaks, as otherwise they won't be cooked evenly. 
- Melt some butter in a pan on high heat. 
- Cover your chicken in flour and cook it on both sides for about 3 minutes, until golden brown. 
- Meanwhile, mince some garlic and ginger. Once your chicken is browned, lower the heat and add these aromatics. 
- Finally, create a sauce by adding soy sauce, apple vinegar and hoisin sauce to taste. I usually do a 2:1:1 ratio. 
- Serve with rice

## ENJOY!!
