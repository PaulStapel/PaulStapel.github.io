I love Hoisin sauce, and a little while ago, I ate some Peking Duck with Hoisin sauce that also added some ginger to the sauce. I fell in love, and decided to adapt one of my signature recipes (Hoisin ground beef) to this amazing flavor combination. The result is this all-new recipe. 

## Ingredients
- ground beef
- 5-spice seasoning
- Cooking oil
- Ginger
- Garlic
- Hoisin sauce
- Soy sauce (half dark, half light)
- Oyster sauce
- Sesame oil
- Spring onion (green part, for garnish)
 
## Cooking plan
- Season your ground beef with 5-spice and brown it in an oiled pan on high heat. 
- Chop up your garlic and ginger, once the beef has browned, plate it and let it rest while you cook your aromatics until fragrant. 
- Next, add back in your ground beef, and add oyster sauce, soy sauce, Hoisin sauce, and sesame oil in a 2:3:2:1 ratio. I usually go with 1 tbsp Hoisin sauce for every 500 grams of beef. 
- Season to taste with salt and more 5-spice. 
- Garnish with spring onion and serve with rice. 

## ENJOY!!
