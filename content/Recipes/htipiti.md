It is pronounced "tee-pee-tee" by the way. Serve with pita or something, idk, idc, I'm not your mom. 

## Ingredients
- Feta cheese
- Red bell peppers
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt
- Red wine vinegar or lemon juice
- Black pepper

## Cooking plan
- Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celcius
- Cut the four sides of your bell peppers and reduce the stem. Lay them out on a baking tray and put them in the oven for roughly 25 minutes. 
- Once your peppers are done, put them in a bowl and cover them to let them steam for another 10 to 20 minutes. This will make it easier to remove the skin of the peppers. 
- To a food processor, add feta cheese, your bell peppers (skin removed), a little red wine vinegar/lemon juice and some extra virgin olive oil.
- Finally, season to taste with salt and pepper. 

## ENJOY!!
