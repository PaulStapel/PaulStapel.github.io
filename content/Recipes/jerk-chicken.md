Yesterday, I combined my love for Jamaican food and inventing new foods to come up with a delicious take on jerk chicken. The result is this simple recipe that consists of simply grilling the chicken and then broiling it in the flavorsome jerk sauce. I usually serve this with a baguette, as the sauce is just heavenly for dipping. 

## Ingredients
I am trying to experiment with measurements, as I've had quite some people approach me saying they would like to know exactly how much to add of each ingredient. Keep in mind that I don't exactly measure my ingredients, and that these measurements are thus geusstimates of how much I usually add. 
- Chicken legs, skin on
- Bell pepper
- Vegetable oil
- Spring onions (about 4)
- White onion (1)
- Shallots (1 or 2)
- Garlic (about 4 cloves)
- Scotch bonnet pepper (about 2 to 4 depending on spice tolerance)
- Soy sauce (about half a cup or 200 milliliters)
- 5-spice powder (1 tbsp)
- Freshly ground black pepper (1/2 tbsp)
- Salt (a pinch)
- Nutmeg (freshly grated or powder if fresh is not available) (1/2 tsp)
- Ground cloves (1/2 tsp)
- Dried thyme (1 tsp)

## Cooking plan
- Start by preheating an oven to 180 degrees Celcius. 
- To an oiled pan on high heat, add your chicken legs and let them grill until properly browned on all sides. 
- Meanwhile, in a blender or other food processor, add everything except your bell pepper. Be careful with the amount of nutmeg and ground clove, as they can become overwhelming really quickly. While adding ingredients, keep tasting in order to adjust on the fly. The sauce isn't a science, and should be up to personal taste. 
- When your chicken legs have browned, add chunks of bell pepper and let them grill for a little longer. 
- Add your sauce to your pan and let some of the water evaporate before putting it into the oven until your sauce has thickened to desired texture.
- Serve with a baguette or anything bread-like. 

## ENJOY!!
