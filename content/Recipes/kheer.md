I have been making breakfast more of a part of my daily routine lately. I think it has something to do with the fact that a lot of SEA-countries have warm breakfast, and I felt more invigorated last time I visited. So I started experimenting with breakfast recipes, and I have now decided to make it an entire category. To start, i wanted to share this Kheer recipe, as it is easy to make and energising. If you add more sugar, it can also be a dessert. 

## Ingredients. 
- (Cooked) rice (if uncooked, it will take longer as the rice also needs to soften)
- Milk
- Sugar
- Cardamom (optional if you don't have it, but it completes the meal)
- Cinnamon (optional) 

## Cooking plan
- Put your rice in a pan and cover with milk. 
- Set the temperature to high and add sugar and cardamom to taste. Hold a spoon ready to keep tasting until the milk has a desired taste. 
- Keep cooking, making sure to keep the temperature as high as possible. When the milk starts boiling, turn down the temperature until it is simmering. 
- After most of the milk has evaporated and you've ended up with a coarse paste, turn down the heat, serve and store the leftovers. When serving, cover with a sprinkle of cinnamon to make this dish complete. I recommend eating this hot, but cold is also nice, and meal-prepping this breakfast is very possible. 

## ENJOY!
