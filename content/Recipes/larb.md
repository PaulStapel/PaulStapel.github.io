A few years back, I had a trip to Thailand with my family. While there, we ate a lot of very delicious food, and I have been recreating the things I ate there quite often.
One thing that does bug me about doing this, however, is the fact that some of the ingredients can be quite troublesome to acquire. Not today however, as we will be making larb.
The ingredients used for this are quite easy to come by in your local Asian supermarket or even just the grocery store. Serve with rice, naan or even tortilla's. 

## Ingredients

- Ground pork
- Fresh koriander (Both leafs and stems)
- Carrot
- Red onion
- Cucumber
- Light soy sauce
- Sambal Oelek
- Hoisin sauce
- Red chili pepper (adjust to your spice tolerance)
- (Optional) fresh mint for extra unique flavors
- (Optional but highly recommended) fish sauce
- (Optional) lemon to balance the fat
- (Optional) garlic chili paste for extra kick

## Cooking plan

- Start by mixing together the ground pork, fresh kroiander and grated carrot. Also add your hoisin sauce and sambal oelek in a 2:1 ratio. 
- Heat a pan to high heat and cook your ground pork mixture until properly browned. Stir while browning, then turn down the heat to medium. 
- Next, chop up your red onion, cucumber and red pepper and add them to your pan.  
- At this stage, add some light soy sauce to season, along with some optional fish sauce and garlic chili paste to taste. 
- At the end of your cooking, roughly chop up some mint leaves and add them, along with the juice of about half a lemon. Serve immediately after adding your lemon. 

## ENJOY!!
