Before getting started with this recipe, [I must credit the original recipe](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a46330/skillet-sicilian-chicken-recipe/), as it is a classic and this dish is heavily based on it. I really liked the dish, but felt that I could give it a bit of a twist to suit my own taste. From that, this recipe spawned into existence. 

## Ingredients
- Boneless chicken breasts. 
- Butter
- Flour (optional, you can skip this step, but it makes chicken juicier)
- Garlic
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Thyme
- Oregano
- Red pepper flakes (can sub with chili powder)
- Chicken broth
- Sun-dried tomatoes
- Heavy cream
- Grated parmesan
- Parsley (fresh, for garnish, optional)
- Extra virgin olive oil (optional)

## Cooking plan 
- Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celcius.
- Start by seasoning your chicken breasts with salt and black pepper. 
- Melt some butter in an oven-proof pan on high heat. Meanwhile, coat your chicken in flour. 
- Cook your chicken until golden brown (about 2-3 minutes on both sides). Remove from pan and let rest on a plate afterwards. 
- Chop up some garlic and a lot of sun-dried tomatoes, and add them to your pan on medium-low heat. 
- Next, add your heavy cream, thyme, oregano and red pepper flakes (or chili powder).
- Grate some parmesan and add it to your sauce and season to taste with salt and pepper.
- Finally, put your chicken back into the pan and cover in the sauce. Put it into the oven for about 10 minutes, until the sauce has achieved a desireable color. 
- Can be served with pasta, bread or just eaten like this. 

## ENJOY!!
