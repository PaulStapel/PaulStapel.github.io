When it comes to baked goods, I really love freshly baked cookies. As it happens, I also love matcha tea. It was a no-brainer to combine the two of them, and following some hints I found online about creating the perfect cookie, I finally managed to nail down this recipe. 

## Ingredients
- 120 grams of butter
- 1 tbsp of matcha
- 120 grams of all-purpose flour
- 10 grams of bread flour or cornstarch
- 2.5 grams of baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of salt
- A few drops of vanilla extract
- If you have brown sugar; 50 grams white sugar and 90 grams brown sugar
- If you don't have brown sugar; 130 grams of sugar plus about 1.5 tbsp of honey 
- 2 eggs
- 100 grams of white chocolate

## Baking plan
- Start by preheating an oven to 180 degrees Celcius. 
- Next, brown your butter on medium heat. 
- While your butter is browning, mix your flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt and matcha until combined. 
- In another bowl, mix your sugars (and honey). 
- Add brown butter to your sugar, and mix for a little. Add your vanilla extract and eggs. 
- Mix in your dry ingredients and stir until it forms a smooth paste. This may take some muscle. Alternatively, you may use a mixer. 
- Cut up some chunks of white chocolate and mix them into your dough. 
- Put your bowl in the fridge for about an hour, until it has chilled completely. 
- Make scoops from your dough and place them on a baking tray lined with parchement paper. Give them some space, as thew will spread out in the oven. 
- Put your cookies in the oven for about 12 minutes. Let them cool a little before eating, as they will be very soft when they leave your oven. 

## ENJOY!!
