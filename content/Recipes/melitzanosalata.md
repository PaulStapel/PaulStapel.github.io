I love cooking Greek food. Something about the balance of oils, fresh herbs and grilled meats just really gets me going. But Greek food can be more than just gyros and souvlaki. To give our vegetarians some love, and in order to diversify your Greek palette, let me introduce you to this lovely dish called Melitzanosalata (eggplant salad). 

## Ingredients
- A few Eggplants 
- Half a red onion (or a full shallot, if you want a more delicate flavour)
- Olive oil, preferably extra virgin. 
- A clove of garlic
- Apple vinegar (white vinegar also works, just use a bit less)
- Some fresh parsley (can be subbed with oregano)
- Feta cheese (for garnish, can be omitted)
- Olives (for garnish, can be omitted)

## Cooking plan
- Start by roasting your eggplants over a grill or open fire. This takes about 10 minutes, or until the eggplants become soft and mushy inside. 
- Start mixing together olive oil and vinegar in (roughly) a 4:1 ratio, also adding in a minced clove of garlic. 
- Mince your red onion, and put it in a bowl. Add your mixture, and some chopped parsley. 
- Remove your eggplant from the fire, and scoop out the flesh. Process the flesh untill it has become a mush.
- Optional step, you may want to squeeze out excess moisture with a towel, as it may dilute the flavor of your salad. 
- Finally, mix everything together and add some feta cheese and olives to your salad as garnish. 

## ENJOY!
