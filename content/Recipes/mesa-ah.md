There were too many eggplants in my fridge, so I decided to do something about that. I could have made my [melitzanosalata](https://paulstapel.com/recipes/melitzanosalata/), but I didn't feel like that would be filling enough, and it was too cold outside to grill. That's when I stumbled upon a dish I had never heard of before. Behold, the Egyptian dish "mesa'a'ah".

## Ingredients
- Tomato paste (about 1 tsp)
- Eggplants (Like, 2 or something)
- Strained tomatoes (about 500 grams or something)
- Salt
- Dried coriander
- Cumin
- Lots of olive oil
- White onion 
- Garlic (about 6 cloves?)

## Cooking plan
- Dice your onion and mince your garlic. Add olive oil to a pot and cook your aromatics until fragrant and a little browned. 
- Start slicing your eggplants into disks (they will be grilled, so try to keep them thick enough). Afterwards, sprinkle them generously with salt and dried coriander. 
- Add tomato paste to your pot and turn up the heat a little. Be careful not to burn the paste.
- In a separate pan, grill your eggplant slices (in batches if they don't fit in your pan). 
- To your pot, finally add your strained tomatoes and cumin to taste. Let it cook on medium heat while you finish grilling your eggplant.
- Finally, add your eggplant to your pot and cover it in the sauce. Serve wit pita. 

## ENJOY!
