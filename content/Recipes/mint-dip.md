So I am looking more into the indian cuisine. To start things off, I made a simple mint dip to eat with a meal, or just to dip naan in. 

## Ingredients
- Yoghurt
- Mint leaves (dried if fresh isn't available)
- Lemon juice
- A clove of garlic
- Salt and pepper

## Cooking plan
- Finely chop the garlic and mint leaves
- Mix the ingredients to taste

## ENJOY!
