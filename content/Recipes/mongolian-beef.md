This recipe makes for a delicious and saucy beef dish. It takes some time to prepare, but is well worth it. 

### Ingredients

#### Marinade
* Beef (I like using cheap steak for this)
* Shaoxing (Cooking Wine)
* (Dark) Soy Sauce
* Oyster sauce
* Some white pepper
* A little cooking oil
* Baking Soda (To tenderize the meat)
* Cornstarch (To keep the beef moist)

#### Sauce
* Soy Sauce (light or dark)
* Sugar 
* Oyster Sauce
* Shaoxing (To deglaze)
* A little cornstarch + water to thicken

#### Veggies (for stir-fry)
* Garlic
* Ginger
* Spring onion
* Onion
* Bell pepper
* Dried chili pepper (you can remove this if you don't like spicy food)

### Cooking plan
* Cut the beef into strips and mix it with the marinade (add the cornstarch at the end) Let it sit for at least 15 minutes, but preferably a few hours. 
* Cut the vegetables
* Prepare the sauce in a small bowl, with a separate bowl for the cornstarch slurry
* Stir fry the beef in a wok, make sure to use a lot of oil. Take the beef out of the wok when it starts to turn crispy.
* Remove some of the oil, and stir fry the veggies. 
* Add in the sauce and the beef, and season to taste. 

### ENJOY!
