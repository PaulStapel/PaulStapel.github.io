It is no secret that I love greek food. My stomach simply can't get enough of the delicous fatty recipes that Greek people have come up with. Among these hearty recipes, 
moussaka stands out as one of my favorites. I made it for a birthday dinner last week, and the deliciousness is well worth the preperation time.
