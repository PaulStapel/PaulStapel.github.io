So I was looking for something to add some extra flavor to schnitzels, as I really like eating them, but they get a little plain after a while if you only add lemon. That's why I thought of making some kind of mustard sauce, and ended up with this recipe. A friend of mine talked about making béchamel sauce using chicken stock, and after having tried this it actually tasted better than I expected, so I added it to this main recipe. 

## Ingredients
- Flour 
- Butter (in same quantity as flour, or else a tad more)
- Dijon mustard (about a tbsp per tbsp flour)
- Chicken stock
- Black pepper

## Cooking plan
- Start by melting your butter in a pan. 
- When it has melted, add your flour.
- Whisk your butter and flour together on high heat until your paste starts looking a little like sand and starts to bubble up a little.
- Add your dijon mustard to your sauce and whisk it in. Start whisking and add your chicken stock immediately after. 
- While still whisking, season your sauce with black pepper to taste. Turn the heat up in order to boil your sauce. 
- Once the sauce is boiling (it should have thickened up now), turn the heat to a simmer and let the sauce reduce until it has the desired texture. Once it is reduced to your liking, you are ready to serve. 

## Enjoy!!
