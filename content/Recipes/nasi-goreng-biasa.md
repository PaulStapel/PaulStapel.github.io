I love cooking fried rice, and I wanted to share this basic (Biasa = basic) recipe with you all because it really is versatile and delicious. From this base, a lot of very delicious types of Nasi Goreng can be constructed, and it can be served with almost any Indonesian, Malay, Thai, or even Chinese dish. 

## Ingredients
- Cooking oil (high smoke point)
- Old cooked rice (as dry and grainy as possible)
- Kecap Manis (can be subbed with dark soy sauce combined with palm sugar)
- Garlic
- Shallots
- Fish sauce or Shrimp paste (substitute 2 tbsp fish sauce for 1 tbsp shrimp paste)
- Fresh chilies (optional)

## Cooking plan
- Chop your garlic, shallots and fresh chilies until they are fine. Add them to a bowl. 
- Heat your wok and add a layer of cooking oil to the bottom of it. 
- Next, add your aromatics and cook them for a little while until they begin to brown. 
- Add your rice to the pan, followed by your fish sauce and kecap manis. 
- Make sure to stir and toss your rice while cooking to keep it from sticking to the pan. 
- Stir-fry this until most of the water has evaporated and you are left with loose grains. This only takes about 2 minutes. 

## ENJOY!!
