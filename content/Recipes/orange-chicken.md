I have to admit, this is a guilty pleasure of mine. I don't make this often, as it can take a bit long to make, but I always enjoy it when I do. If you are looking for a sweet and unique taste, look no further than this recipe. I suggest serving this with white rice. 

## Ingredients

### For the meat
- Chicken breasts (whole, or already cubed)
- All purpose flour
- Cornstarch
- High smoke-point oil like peanut oil

### For the sauce
- A bunch of oranges (5 per kilo of chicken, more if you like it saucy)
- Alternatively, you can use orange juice instead of fresh oranges
- A bit of sugar (If it isn't sweet enough already)
- Soy sauce
- Garlic powder
- Ginger (or ginger powder)
- Cornstarch (to thicken the sauce)

## Cooking plan

- Squeeze the oranges and strain the juice. 
- Add some soy sauce, garlic powder, ginger, (optional sugar) and cornstarch to the mixture. 
- Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces (TIP; use sciccors)
- Create a batter by mixing the flour and cornstarch in a ratio of about 2/1. Add a bit of water until the batter is smooth and then add a little bit of oil untill the batter is only a little thick. 
- Heat up a pan of your oil untill very hot. You can check this by putting in a drop of your batter. 
- Coat your chicken in your batter, and start adding the pieces to your pan one by one. Do this slowly, so that the pieces won't stick to eachother. Be careful with splashing, as the oil doesn't like the water of the batter. To prevent splashing, add some salt to the oil. Put the browned pieces onto a seperate plate. 
- Once all chicken has been fried once, you can choose to fry them again. this will make the coloring nicer, and it will add a nicer crisp to the chicken.
- Store the oil somewhere for later use, and pour your sauce mixture into the hot pan. Let it reduce at high heat untill the sauce becomes thick to your liking. I'd suggest letting it thicken a little longer than you'd think. 
- Finally, add back the chicken, and coat it in the sauce. Serve it while it's hot, and try not to let it rest too long, because it will lose its crisp. 

## ENJOY!
