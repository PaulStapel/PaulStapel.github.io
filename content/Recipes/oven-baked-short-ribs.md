**!Be aware that this recipe takes about 4 hours to finish!** I love myself a good hunk of meat, and short ribs are a satisfying fill that can feed quite some guests. I don't grill often, and so I have to get creative when it comes to making ribs, but I have found that ovens work well enough for most pieces of meat. So that's exactly what we will be using :)

## Ingredients
- Short ribs (Duh)

### Rub 
- Salt
- Pepper
- Roasted paprika powder
- Cumin
- Garlic powder
- Onion powder

### Glaze
See [this post for the sauce I use to glaze the ribs](https://paulstapel.com/recipes/bbq-sauce/).

## Cooking plan
- Preheat an oven to 160 degrees Celcius. 
- Mix the ingredients for your rub. If you fear that it will not stick to the meat, use a little olive oil to make it a little stickier. 
- Start by removing the membrane from your short ribs. In order to do this, take a butter knife and wiggle it between the meat and the membrane. Then, pull it up to create some room for your fingers to get between the meat and membrane. From there, you should be able to pull the rest of the membrane up towards you and off the ribs. 
- Next, rub your dry rub on all sides of your short ribs. Make sure to lay it on thick. 
- Tightly wrap your ribs in about 2 layers of aluminum foil such that no steam can escape, and put it on an oven sheet. 
- Put your ribs in the oven for about 3 hours and 20 minutes. 
- In the meantime, prepare your glaze. It can be stored in the fridge if you want, so you can make it anytime. 
- When your ribs are done, unpack them from the aluminum foil and glaze them using a cooking brush. Put the oven to about 180 degrees celcius and put them back in for another 20 to 30 minutes. If you want your ribs to be saucy, add some more sauce near the end of the cooking. 
- This last phase can be nicely paired with [some oven-roasted veggies](https://paulstapel.com/recipes/roasted-veggies/), as these pair very nicely with these ribs. 

## ENJOY!!
