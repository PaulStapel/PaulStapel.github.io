This is one of my favorite recipes from the Thai kitchen. The combination of ground beef with the aromatics and delicious holy basil just hits different. I'm happy to share this recipe with you today. 

## Ingredients
- Ground beef
- Holy basil leafs
- Black pepper
- Garlic
- Lemongrass (optional aromatic)
- Dried or fresh chilies
- Chicken stock
- Fish sauce
- Cooking oil 
- Cilantro (optional)
- Lime (optional for garnish)

## Cooking plan
- Start by mincing or grinding the garlic, lemongrass and chilies (aromatics) into a paste
- Next, heat some oil in a wok (or pan) until smoking hot
- Stir-fry your ground beef until browned (so for about 3-4 minutes)
- Next, push aside your meat and add some more oil to cook your aromatics until fragrant and a little crispy. Stir it into your ground beef when finished. 
- Add black pepper, chicken stock and fish sauce and let it reduce into the beef mixture. 
- Finally, add your holy basil (and optional cilantro) and season to taste. Garnish with a squeeze of lime juice (optionally)

## ENJOY!!
