## Ingredients
- Whole peanuts
- Sesame seeds
- Peanut butter
- Noodles (I use udon noodles)
- Spring onion
- Soy sauce (I use dark, but light works as well for a stronger flavor)
- Vinegar (I use Chinkiang vinegar)
- Chili oil (Lao Gan Ma also works)
- Garlic
- Ginger

## Cooking plan
- Grind some of your peanuts and leave some whole for a more interesting texture. Then, start by toasting your whole peanuts and sesame seeds. 
- Next, finely mince your garlic and ginger, add chili oil to your pan and saut√© your aromatics. 
- Meanwhile, bring some water to a boil and cook your noodles per package instructions. 
- Once fragrant, add the white part of your spring onion as well. 
- To your pan, add some vinegar, soy sauce and some scoops of peanut butter to taste. Mix well, as the peanut butter needs to be fully encorporated into the sauce. 
- Finally mix your noodles through your sauce and garnish with the green part of your spring onion. 

## ENJOY!!
