I really love Thai food, but I've not been making much of it as of late. I kind of thought it time to change that, so in that spirit I'd like to present to you this Thai Phanaeng curry. 

## Ingredients

- Cocounut milk
- Kaffir lime leafs
- Fish sauce
- Pork, beef or chicken (Cubed, but anything goes) (Make vegetarian by omitting)
- Bell pepper (sliced into thin strips)
- Curry paste (see below)
- Cooking oil 
- Salt

### Curry paste
- 1 Shallot
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 2 bottom halves of lemongrass stalks
- 2 tbsp (roasted) peanuts
- 8 - 12 dried red chilies
- 0.5 - 1 tsp cumin powder
- 0.5 tsp nutmeg
- 1.5 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tbsp galangal (tumeric works too)
- 1 tsp shrimp paste (miso paste works too)
- A few kaffir lime leafs
- Pinch of salt and white pepper

## Cooking plan
- Put all of the curry paste ingredients in a (spice) mixer and add a little water to form a paste. 
- Season your meat with some fish sauce and cooking oil. 
- Cook some (but not all) of your coconut milk until it becomes frothy, then add your curry paste to it. 
- Stir for a bit, then add your kaffir lime leafs and finally your meat. 
- Cook your meat through until rare, then add some salt and fish sauce to season. 
- Finally, stir in your bell pepper. 
- Serve with jasmine rice. 

## ENJOY!!
