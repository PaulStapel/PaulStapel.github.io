I love Mexican food, and I can never resist a good salsa. I wanted to start making more salsa whenever I make Mexican food from now on, and I decided to start with a pico de gallo, as it is well defined and a tried and true recipe. This is definetely not my own recipe, as I am just throwing ingredients in a bowl, but I will outline some of the things I do to make it taste even better. 

## Ingredients
- White onion
- Tomato
- Jalepeño 
- Lime (juice)
- Salt
- Coriander (cilantro) 

## Cooking plan
- In a large bowl, squeeze the juice of about 2 - 3 limes. Add about a tsp of salt. This step will help pickle your ingredients slightly, and adds flavor of course. 
- Chop your white onion into fine pieces and put it in the bowl
- Chop up your Jalepeño and put it in the bowl.
- Chop up your tomatoes and put them in the bowl. Be careful with the moisture content; you may choose to squeeze your tomato with a cheese cloth or towel. You could also choose to only include the flesh and to remove the seeds. The amount of tomatoes depends on you, but go on how your salsa looks when mixed. 
- Finally, chop up some coriander (cilantro) and mix everything together. 
- You may serve right away, but the taste will be even better if stored overnight. 
- When serving, you may want to drain some of the excess moisture. You can also strain your salsa if you feel it necessary. 

## ENJOY!!
