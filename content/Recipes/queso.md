When I have guests around, I want to make something easy and filling that I can just put on the table and forget about. Dips are perfect for this, as it creates a central piece whereabout everyone can gather. I really like this recipe as a guilty pleasure, and would like to share it with you all now. 

## Ingredients
- Ground beef or chorizo (about 300 to 400 grams)
- White onion (one large white onion)
- Flour (2 tbsp)
- Milk (1.5 cups, less if you want a more solid queso)
- Mozerella (2 pieces)
- Old cheese (To taste)
- Parmesan (To taste)
- Cilantro (a.k.a. coriander) (To taste)
- Salt and black pepper (be mindful of salt content in your other ingredients) (To taste)
- Diced chipotle peppers (optional, add extra rich flavor and makes the whole more varied)

## Cooking plan
- Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celcius. 
- In a skillet, brown your ground beef or heat up your chorizo. Season it with salt and pepper. While it is browning, chop up a white onion. 
- Once browned, add your chopped onion and stir on high heat until translucent and a little browned. 
- Add some flour to your pan and let it heat up for a bit. Then, add your milk as well. 
- Add your mozerella, and grate your old cheese and parmesan. Add it to the pan and let it melt a bit. 
- Stir through some cilantro (and diced chipotle peppers) and further season to taste with more salt and pepper if necessary. 
- Put your skillet int he oven until you queso has bubbled up and has achieved a golden yellow color. 

## ENJOY!!
