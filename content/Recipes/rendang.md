When I really want to cook something great, I like to take my time. Rendang is one of the beef stew(-like) meals I like to cook. I usually don't have galangal at home, but this recipe can also work without, still keeping that amazing taste!

## Ingredients
- Beef (lean)
- Coconut milk
- Neutral cooking oil
- Clove powder (a little)
- Nutmeg powder (a little)
- Kurkuma powder
- Cinnamon stick
- Star anise
- Kaffir lime leafs
- Lemongrass (stalk, smashed)
- Tamarind paste

### Paste
- Garlic (3 cloves)
- White onion (half a large white onion, or one medium-small one)
- Lemongrass (white part, smashed) (2 stalks)
- Dried chilis (about 6)
- Ginger (Medium sized piece)
- Salt
- Tumeric (Or galangal if you have it)

## Cooking plan
- Add some oil to a pot and start by browning your beef. 
- Meanwhile, use a mortar and pestle to ground up your paste. 
- Once your beef is browned, remove it from the pan and cook your paste for a few minutes, until it turns (dark) orange. 
- Add your star anise, cinnamon stick, clove powder, kurkuma powder, nutmeg powder, kaffir lime leafs and lemongrass. 
- Cut your beef into chunks and add it to the pot along with the residual juices.
- Add your coconut milk and tamarind paste to the pan, and let it simmer for about 2 hours. 
- Once the beef is tender and your coconut milk has reduced a bit, turn up the heat and finally reduce until most of the moisture has evaporated and the sauce clings to the beef. This should take about another 30 minutes. 
- Serve with rice. 

## ENJOY!!
