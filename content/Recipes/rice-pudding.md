Whenever I have rice left over, there are two things that immediately come to mind. Storing it to stir-fry it later, or turning it into a pudding if I have time to do so. This is the ultimate thoughtless recipe for when you want to keep your hands busy while listening to music for example.

## Ingredients

* (Left over) rice
* Milk
* Sugar
* Vanilla extract (optional)

## Cooking plan

* Submerge the rice in milk.
* Add sugar to taste (I like it a little less sweet).
* Stir over a medium-low heat until the texture is smooth.
* Finally, you can choose to add a little vanilla extract. 

## ENJOY!
