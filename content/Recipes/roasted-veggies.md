This post is a simple one, but simple does not always have to equal bland. Usually when veggies are served, I find them a little dull, but I have just recently opened my eyes to the possibilities of some good ol' roasted veggies. Pair them with a juicy piece of meat, and you've got yourself a wonderful meal. 

## Ingredients
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper
- Dried Italian herbs (rosemary, basil, oregano, thyme, parsley)
- Mustard
- Grated cheese (only a little, ads a nice flavor and crisp)

## Veggies
Choose any combination of: 
- Garlic
- Red onion
- Carrot
- Zucchini
- Bell pepper
- Brocolli
- Potato
- Sweet potato
- Cauliflower
- Brussel sprouts
- Eggplant
- Asparagus
- Anything else you like roasted

## Cooking plan
- Preheat your oven to about 180 degrees Celcius.
- Chop your vegetables into bite-sized pieces. 
- Mix your pieces in a bowl, and add your other ingredients EXCEPT the cheese. Mix until everything is coated. 
- Line your vegetables on a parchment-lined baking sheet, making sure not to overcrowd it. 
- Put your tray into the oven for 30 minutes, coating your veggies with some cheese and flipping them over halfway through. 

## ENJOY!!
