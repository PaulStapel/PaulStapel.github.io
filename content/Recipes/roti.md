I love roti, and having now made it myself, I can safely say that its lovely flavor carries over to the home kitchen.

## Ingredients
- Flour (500 grams)
- Butter (40 grams)
- Butter (80+ grams) (used for cooking)
- Water (200 grams)
- Salt (1 teaspoon)

## Cooking plan
- Heat about 40 grams of butter in a pan until melted. 
- Add together this melted butter, your flour and water. Mix in a dough mixer or by using two forks until your dough is smooth and not as sticky anymore. 
- Roll out your dough into thin sheets. The thinner they are, the better they will be cooked once they go into your pan. 
- Cook your roti at high heat in a skillet or non-stick pan. For each roti you cook, coat the pan with butter and lay your roti on it. Wait until it bubbles up a little and starts to brown, and then flip it over. Your roti should be coated in the butter, so add more if you didn't add enough. 

## Tips
- You may want to pre-melt your butter used for cooking. This way, you have more control over the amount of butter added, and you can add more or less depending on the thickness of your dough (for thicker dough, it would be better to add twice instead of just once, so as to evenly coat both sides). 
- You can rest your dough for about 15 minutes if time permits. This makes it easier to handle the dough. It does not do much for the flavor from what I have noticed, but it made rolling into sheets a bit easier for me. 

## ENJOY!
