I am becoming a little obsessed with Indian cuisine, and while searching for new things to cook I stumbled upon Saagwala, and because I am a large fan of spinach, I simply had to try this. I find it is best served with Naan, but Roti and rice would also complement it quite well. 

## Ingredients

### Marinate
- Chicken (bone-in)
- Cooking oil (1 tbsp)
- Yoghurt (full) (enough to cover)
- Cayenne powder (2 tsp)
- Garam masala (2 tsp)
- Coriander powder (2 tsp)
- Cumin powder (1 tsp)
- Fenugreek seeds (1 tsp)
- tumeric powder (1/2 tsp)

### Curry
- Spinach (a load of spinach, about equal weight to your meat)
- Vegetable oil
- White onions (minced)
- Garlic (minced)
- Ginger (grated)
- Tomato paste
- Red or green chili
- Heavy cream (yoghurt would also work)
- Mint leafs (fresh, but dried also works)
- Cumin powder
- Coriander powder
- Garam masala
- Tumeric powder
- Cayenne powder

## Cooking plan
- Start by marinating your chicken beforehand. Leave for at least 1 hour, but for about 6 hours or more if possible. Mix all of your marinate ingredients.
- Preheat your oven to 200 degrees Celcius. Once it is warm, place your chicken on a baking sheet lined with parchment and cook for 30 minutes, turning it over after 15 minutes. 
- While this is happening, boil some water and cook your spinach for about 5 minutes, until it has wilted completely. Once your spinach is done, drain it and blend it into a smooth paste. 
- In a large pan, start by heating up some vegetable oil and stir frying your white onions, garlic and ginger.
- Once browned a little, add your chili pepper and tomato paste, stiring all the while. 
- Next, add your spices. Cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala, tumeric powder and cayenne powder. 
- Stir back in your spinach and cover with heavy cream or yoghurt. Mix your curry well and let it cook through a little. If it is too thick, you may add some water or coconut milk. 
- When your chicken is done, add it back to your curry. 
- Garnish with fresh mint leafs. You may add some swirls of heavy cream or yoghurt for garnish as well. 

## ENJOY!!
