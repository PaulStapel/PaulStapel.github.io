This recipe is a Paul-certified classic. It is easy to make (only about 30 minutes), and is quite filling for when you are having a busy week. 

## Ingredients

- Sausage (pork works well)
- Cooking oil
- A (small) tin of tomtato paste
- Yellow onion
- Garlic
- Bell peppers (different colors looks the nicest, doesn't really matter for taste)
- Beef broth
- Garam masala (can sub for 5-spice)
- Pepper
- Dark soy sauce (for color and salt)

## Cooking plan

- First, cook your sausage in an oiled pan until golden brown. Get some Maillard reaction going. 
- Put the sausage aside and cut it into bit-sized pieces. 
- Dice your onion and bell peppers, and heat them in the pan until most of the water has evaporated. 
- Add your garlic and tomato paste, and let it cook until fragrant. 
- Add your garam masala and pepper to a beef broth. You should be able to smell it. 
- Add the seasoned beef broth and cooked sausage into the pan, and let the mixture reduce to a desired texture. 
- Finally, add some dark soy sauce for color and salt. 

## ENJOY!
