At first, I was planning on making scones. Because of a lack of better moulds, I decided to use a muffin tray, and the rest is history. This recipe yields about 12 medium-sized scuffins. 

## Ingredients
- 500 grams of all-purpose flour
- 200 grams of granulated sugar
- About 10 grams of baking powder
- 2 eggs
- 250 grams of butter
- 200 grams of crème fraîche
- About 20 milliliters of milk
- About 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract
- A pinch of salt
- Optionally, toppings like milk chocolate, blueberries or caramel
- A muffin tray

## Baking plan
- Preheat an oven to 200 degrees Celsius. 
- Add the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder to a large bowl.
- In small cubes or pieces, add in the butter while mixing your bowl. I mix using a mixer, but a whisk would work as well. Mix until you are left with a crumbly dough. 
- Add in your vanilla extract, crème fraîche and eggs. Mix together until the dough becomes sticky and thick. Add in your milk incrementally to make your batter less thick. It should still be sticky!
- Butter a muffin tray and fill it with your batter. I used two spoons to transfer the batter, as it will easily stick to your hands. 
- With a glove (or your bare hands), push in your toppings. Use a bit more than you might initially think, as the flavours may be lost in the batter.  
- Bake your scuffins in the oven for about 20 - 25 minutes, until they are golden brown. 
- Serve with clotted cream and jam. (for a quick and easy clotted cream, mix mascarpone and crème fraîche)
