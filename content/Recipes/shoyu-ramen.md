Shoyu ramen is an amazing dish that can be extended to your liking very easily. The name of this ramen dish comes from the addition of soy sauce to your broth (Shoyu = Japanese soy sauce). As this recipe can be made with lots of different ingredients, I will simply suggest some of the ingredients you could add to your ramen. This recipe may take some multi-tasking if you are adding a lot of toppings, so prepping well is recommended!

## Ingredients

### Broth
- Garlic
- Ginger
- Sesame oil
- Chicken broth
- Noodles (cooked inside of the broth for convenience)

### Shoyu pork
- (Rather thin) slices of pork
- Soy sauce
- Black pepper
- A little sugar
- A little cooking oil

### Other toppings, add to own taste
- Soft boiled eggs
- Scallions (the greens)
- Shiitake mushrooms
- Pickled ginger
- Grated carrot
- Spinach
- Seaweed
- Brocolli
- Bean sprouts
- Your own additions :)

## Cooking plan

### Broth
- In a large (soup) pan, start by heating some sesame oil. 
- Add finely minced ginger and garlic to your pan, and cook until fragrant.
- If adding shiitake, I would suggest adding it at this stage.  
- Next, add your chicken broth and let it reduce a little. 
- Finally, add your noodles and cook until done. Try to time this such that your noodles don't get soggy while you are preparing your other ingredients. 

### Meat 
- In another pan (non-stick works well), start by heating up some of your cooking oil. 
- Season your pork with pepper and salt if you are sure your broth isn't too salty. 
- Cook your pork to your liking, a little crisp for example. 
- Finally, coat with some soy sauce and sugar. 

### Toppings and plating
- Prepare your toppings as you would normally.
- To assemble your ramen: Start by putting noodles in a large ramen bowl (or equivalent), and cover it in your broth. Then, put in your pork with soy sauce and mix. This step makes your ramen into shoyu ramen. Finally, add your toppings just before serving. 

### ENJOY!!
