I, like most people, like s'mores. Shame that I don't really like camping that much :/ but a well. Luckily, I don't have to miss out on this treat, as I can just use my oven to make s'mores in a pan. 
I was originally not going to write down the recipe, but after struggling with the marshmallows sticking to the pan the first time, I decided it would be helpful to also explain an easy trick to prevent that from happening. 

## Ingredients
- Chocolate (I use thin chocolate bars)
- Marshmallows
- Graham crackers
- Butter (Non-stick secret number one) 
- Parchment paper (thick) (Non-stick secret number two)

## Baking plan
- Preheat an oven to roughly 220 degrees Celcius.  
- Line a cast iron pan with parchment paper, or coat it in butter. 
- Layer the bottom of the pan with chocolate. 
- Layer the chocolate with marshmallows
- Put your pan in the oven for about 8 to 10 minutes, until the marshmallows are golden brown on the top. 
- Eat straight out of the pan with graham crackers (don't burn yourself!). 

## Tips
- Don't worry if you made too much, you can put your chocolate-marshmallow-mess between two graham crackers and store them in a container for later. This way, you've made your own delicious s'more cookies. 
- If you are using parchment paper, be sure to use paper that won't rip, as the marshmallows can become rather sticky. You don't want to be eating paper, haha.

## ENJOY!!
