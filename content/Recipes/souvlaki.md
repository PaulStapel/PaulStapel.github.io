This is a lovely meaty dish that you can serve as a main course. With summer at its peak, you enjoy this dish on straight from the grill during a barbecue for example. 

## Marinate
- (extra virgin) olive oil
- Oregano
- Sweet paprika powder
- Thyme (optional)
- Bay leaves
- Juice from a lemon
- LOTS OF GARLIC
- Salt and pepper
- Chicken (cubed, which you'll marinate)

## Cooking plan
- Mince the garlic. You should use enough that you can smell it. I used 8 cloves (slightly more than a bulb) per kilo last time.  
- Mix everything into a ziplock bag or marinating bowl.
- Stir in the chicken, and let it sit for an hour or preferably two (not for too long! The lemon will slowly cook the chicken, lessening its taste after a certain amount of time)
- Skewer the chicken (or cook it in a skillet if you want). You can grill the skewers on a barbecue. 

## ENJOY!
