I love wokking, but it has been a bit too cold to use my wok in the last few months. Today however, I just couldn't resist the urge to wok, and this delicious recipe is the result. 

## Ingredients

### Marinade
- Beef tips
- Soy sauce
- Black pepper
- Hoisin sauce
- Cornstarch
- Baking powder
- Sugar

### Sauce
- Hoisin sauce (2 tbsp) (1 tbsp if you like it a little less sweet)
- Chili garlic sauce (1 tbsp)
- Honey (1 tbsp) 
- Soy sauce (2 tbsp)
- Water (2 tbsp) 
- Sesame seeds (optional)

### For wokking
- White or yellow onion 
- Green peppers (to add some nice spice, don't remove the seeds) 
- Spring onion
- Bell peppers (can sub for green peppers if you don't like spicy)
- Vegetable oil

## Cooking plan

- Combine your marinade in a bowl and let it sit while you prepare your veggies and sauce. For this marinade, combine soy sauce and hoisin sauce in a 3/1 ratio. The cornstarch is meant to retain moisture for your beef tips, and the baking powder is a secret technique to make your meat more tender in a short amount of time. 
- Next, prepare your sauce by mixing all ingredients in a bowl. 
- Chop your veggies into large chunks. 
- Prepare your wok with some vegetable oil and wait until your wok is smoking hot. 
- Add your veggies and stir-fry until browned a little. 
- Next, add your beef and quickly stir-fry until browned and a little crispy. 
- Finally, add your sauce and reduce until it creates a nice coating on your meat and veggies. 
- Serve with white rice

## ENJOY!!
