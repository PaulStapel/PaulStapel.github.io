Ok, so the description may have been a lie. I usually don't barbecue because Dutch weather can be very unpredictable (Dutch struggles). Instead, I like to put stuff in the oven (like a true patriot). Therefore, this dish will be using our favorite inferno machine. The TTC (time to cook) is about an hour, so prepare it well in advance! 

## Ingredients
- White onions
- Shredded cheese (Gouda, because it melts well and because it's Dutch)
- Butter
- Paprika powder
- Chopped parsley
- Dried thyme
- Dried oregano
- Aluminum foil

## Cooking plan
- Preheat an oven to 160 degrees Celsius. 
- Start peeling the onions and cutting them into rings. 
- In a casserole, layer the onion rings. If you have lots of mouths to feed, make multiple layers. 
- On top of your layer of onion rings, add your herbs and cheese. Add a generous amount of cheese, but reserve some for later.
- Finally, add some small cubes of butter spread evenly throughout the dish and cover it with the aluminum foil. Put it in the oven and cook for 40 minutes. 
- After 40 minutes, take out your casserole. Sprinkle over a little of your remaining cheese, and put it back into the oven, uncovered. Leave it in for another 20 minutes, and you're ready to serve. 

## ENJOY!
