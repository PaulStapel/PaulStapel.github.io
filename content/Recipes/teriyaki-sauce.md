I love eating this sauce with, for example, chicken and noodles. Do note that this sauce is by no means traditional, and is a take for the home kitchen for people that don't have the ingredients to make traditional teriyaki sauce. I also have [a more traditional recipe](https://paulstapel.com/recipes/traditional-teriyaki-sauce/) on my blog, so give that one a try as well, and see for yourself which you like best!

## Ingredients
* Sesame seeds (optional, adds flavour and thickens sauce)
* Soy Sauce
* Honey
* Sugar (only a little if you like it less sweet)
* Garlic powder
* Grated ginger
* Sesame oil (optional, ads nice sesame flavours)
* Some water
* Cornstarch (Add if you like a thicker sauce)

## Cooking plan
* Add all ingredients to a pan, and stir over medium heat until desired taste and texture is achieved. Go easy on the sesame oil. 

## ENJOY!
