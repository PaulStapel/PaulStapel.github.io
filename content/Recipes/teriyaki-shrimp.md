I like shrimp, as they are easy to put in the freezer and stir fry when needed. I try to have some shrimp in the freezer so that I can always have a quick meal ready, and this teriyaki shrimp recipe is really easy and tasty. 

## Ingredients
- Cooking oil 
- Shrimp
- Garlic
- Ginger
- Soy sauce
- Vinegar
- Sugar
- Cornstarch
- Mirin (optional)
- Green onion (optional)
- Sesame seeds (optional)

## Cooking plan
- Dice your ginger and garlic
- In a hot wok, add a little oil, and stir fry your shrimp until it browns a little and is fully orange
- Next, lower the heat and add your garlic and ginger. 
- Pour in your optional mirin and let it reduce until thick. 
- Make a sauce of sugar (less if you use mirin), vinegar, soy sauce and a bit of cornstarch and add it to the hot wok. Reduce on high heat until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. 
- Finally, garnish with the green part of your green onion and some sesame seeds. 

## ENJOY!!
