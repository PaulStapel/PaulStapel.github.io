I wanted to create an easy dish that incorporates some more complex flavors, and haven't cooked with salmon in quite a bit. That's why I decided to create a new recipe using this fishy friend. 

## Ingredients
- Salmon (fresh, skin-on, but frozen also works great!)
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Olive oil
- Garlic
- Shallots
- Ginger
- Brown sugar
- Honey
- Thai red curry paste 
- Coconut milk 
- Fish sauce
- Half a lime (for the juice)
- Holy basil (or substitute for regular basil with a touch of anise powder)

## Cooking plan
- If you are using fresh salmon, season with salt and pepper then cook it on its skin with olive oil until golden brown. If you are using frozen salmon, start by thawing the salmon. 
- Chop up your shallots and cook them in the same pan on medium-high heat to quickly caramelise them. Once starting to brown, add some chopped ginger and garlic.
- Meanwhile preheat an oven to 220 degrees Celcius. 
- Next, add some brown sugar and red curry paste and cook out its water contents for about 1 or 2 minutes.
- Next add your coconut milk, a splash of fish sauce, juice from half a lime and some holy basil (or substitute), and stir it together. 
- Finally, lay your salmon into the sauce without covering the top in sauce. Just let it cook a bit while your sauce reduces. 
- Put some honey and brown sugar on your salmon to glaze it, and then put your pan in the oven. Cook for about 5 - 10 minutes, or until your sugar has begun to caramelise a bit. You could also achieve this with a kitchen blowtorch. I like how the sauce turns out when you put it in the oven for a bit, so that's what I usually do. 
- Serve with rice, or even a pasta if you wish to be multicultural.

## ENJOY!!
