Ok, so last week I was thinking about what I wanted to cook, when I stumbled upon some inspiration for meatballs in tomato sauce, thinking back to how delicious those were back when I visited Greece. Now I am not about to tell you that this is an authentic Greek recipe (it is more of an Italian recipe I believe), but this is an authentic Paul banger, and as such, I would love to share it with you all. If you don't feel like rolling meatballs, you can also just use ground beef. This has the added benefit of making storage for later easier. 

## Ingredients. 

### Meatballs
- Ground beef or ground pork
- Carrots
- Garlic
- Pepper
- Olive oil
- Some parsley
- Some (Romano) cheese
- A few eggs

### Sauce
- Tomato paste
- Cherry tomatoes
- Tomato concentrate (that's right, we are going for the triple whammy)
- Red onion
- Beef stock
- Salt
- Oregano 

### Serve with any of: 
- Couscous
- Spaghetti
- Bread

## Cooking plan
- Start by finely chopping your carrots, garlic and parsley. Also grate your cheese. 
- Now, mix together all of the meatball ingredients. 
- To a pan, add oil and turn on the heat. Roll your meat mixture into balls and fry them in your pan. Once properly cooked, store them in a plate for a bit. 
- In another pan (or the same if you want to wait until you are done frying the meatballs), start by sweating the onions in some cooking oil. 
- Once done, add your tomato concentrate and let it cook for a bit until fragrant. 
- After that, add your tomato paste. Again, let it cook for a bit. 
- While the tomato paste is cooking, blend your cherry tomatoes into a paste. Then, add it to your pan. 
- Add a generous amount of oregano to the pan. 
- Add back in your meatballs and cover with a bit of stock. Let this simmer and reduce until you have a nice tomato sauce with a bit of a thick consistency. 
- Finally, salt to taste before serving with some couscous.
