So half a year ago, I shared with you a recipe for teriyaki sauce. Back then, I didn't really have the ingredients to make traditional teryiyaki sauce, and thus I created an alternative that tasted close to the original in flavour. But of course, we must pay respect to tradition, and that's why we'll be making traditional teriyaki sauce today. For comparison, you can also try my [original recipe](https://paulstapel.com/recipes/teriyaki-sauce/) and see which you like best. From there, you can always iterate further on this recipe. 

## Ingredients
Liquid ingredients in a 3:3:1 ratio. Add more sake if you want your sauce less thick. Add more mirin if you want your sauce thicker.  
- Mirin 
- Sake
- Soy sauce 
- (Optionally) A little more brown sugar to taste, as sugar content of the mirin can vary by brand. I suggest tasting the miring first. 
- (Optionally) A few slices of ginger. Some argue this is traditional, while others swear by omitting them. 

## Cooking plan
Try tasting each of the phases of cooking to get a better understanding of what each of these ingredients adds to the table. 

- To a pan on medium-high heat, add your mirin and let it reduce until it is glossy and thick enough to where you can draw lines with a spatula. (Add ginger and sugar here if you want to include them). 
-  Next, add your sake and let it cook until all of the alcohol has been removed (you should be able to smell/taste this). 
- Finally, add your soy sauce and broil until your sauce is glossy. Then, further reduce until you have reached the desired texture (Be aware that the sauce will thicken a little once it is done). 
- Serve with anything you want. This sauce can be stored for later use. 

## ENJOY!
