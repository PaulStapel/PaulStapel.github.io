After a trip to Greece, I fell in love with greek cuisine. Of course, you cant say Greek without Tzatziki, and so I will share this easy recipe for this beloved sauce.

### Ingredients

* Dill
* Cucumber 
* Some salt

### Preparation 
* Finely grate a cucumber and wring out the moisture using a towel. 
* Finely press the garlic, and add it to the yoghurt along with the other ingredients. 
* Season to taste

### ENJOY!
