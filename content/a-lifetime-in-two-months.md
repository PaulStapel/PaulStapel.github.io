-- Sept 5th, 2025
It was the middle of the night as I checked my bags for the third and final time. My flight to Bangkok would be a late one, and I was about to leave my parents' apartment. Looking back, this whole day of travel was a complete blur in light of all the initial setbacks to come, but that final interaction with my mom has engraved itself in my memory nonetheless. She had just woken up to send me off, and she can get quite emotional when she knows she won't be seeing me or my brother for a long time. Despite this, there was more of pride than of sorrow in her voice, and she simply told me: "het zijn maar twee maanden (it's just two months), but make it a lifetime". So that is what I did. 

-- First week
I don't quite know why, but I've had a fascination (of varying intensity) with China for as long as I can remember. It represented delicious food, ancient and deep culture, stunning nature; a world unknown. It was on a whim that I decided I should finally travel there to start learning 汉语/Mandarin, and to experience this culture for my own. After some headache-inducing logistics because of delayed-and-thus-missed flights I had finally arrived: 成都/Chengdu. 

Welllll, it was quite a troublesome first week. Because of the aforementioned delayed-and-thus-missed (there must be an easier term for this) flights, my arrival time in Chengdu was 01:00 AM, meaning I had to figure out public transit, the route to my apartment (a 80 minute drive from the airport) and payments in general while sleep-deprived :D
