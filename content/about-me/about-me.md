Hiya, I'm Paul! I'm a student-writer-programmer hybrid specializing in science. This website is my first public project, and I look forward to sharing more of my work in the future. Nonetheless, you can find everything you need to know about me on this page. 

## Reach out
If you want to reach out, you can currently contact me @ <contact@paulstapel.com>.

Me and my brother also have an inactive wordpress site about Physics. If you want to check it out, [here's the link!](https://phyzards.com). You can also reach me there. 

## Currently working on
I am currently following these courses at Utrecht University: 
* Graphics
* Data analysis and retrieval
* Software testing and verification
* Condensed quantum matter
* Statistics

\
On the side, I work on this blog and some personal projects.

I also work as a part-time data analyst for Simplex, a Dutch consultancy agency that specialises in AFAS-software. In this job, I design and develop dashboards with Power Bi.

## Interests
These are some things I really enjoy talking/writing about. I'm always up for a chat!
* Bachelor level Physics, Maths and CompSci
* Cooking 
* Life-philosophy 
* Books and reading
* Dungeons & Dragons
* (Indie) games
* Anything I blog about
* Any of the skills mentioned below

## Skills
The skills one invests their time in can tell you a lot about someone. These are things I am familiar with. I list a lot of things, but this is not meant to be a flex or part of some CV or whatever. I just like to share the things I have some knowledge of and keep track for personal reasons. In each category, skills are sorted by how comfortable I am with them. 

### Languages
I can speak Dutch and English proficiently, and can comprehend and (poorly) speak German.
* **C#** (Basic desktop apps, algorithmic problem solving, creating simple games)
* **Python** (data-analysis, scientific computing, algorithmic problem solving)
* **SQL** (Querying and simple database creation)
* **HTML & CSS** (Basic static webdev like the website you see before you)
* **Bash/Shell** (navigating and mutating files and directories in zsh, more comfortably every day)
* **Haskell** (Basic programming, creating simple games, using monads)
* **C++** (In the context of hardware systems using arduino)

### Tools
* **Power BI** (A great BI tool I use for work. Mostly like it so far, but have some gripes)
* **Git and GitHub** (By no means an expert, but I manage quite well)
* **VS code** (My IDE of choice, have used for two years now)
* **Homebrew** (Just very useful for mac, sometimes help people with macs transfer their setup with this)
* **HUGO** (The CMS used for this website, learning more every month)
* **NumPy** (Used for all of my scientific computing in Python)
* **Snowflake** (Quite familiar, have used it a bunch for data warehousing in projects)
* **.NET** (All of my c# projects have used the .NET framework)
* **Arduino** (Made some small hardware contraptions and thingamajigs)
* **Monogame** (Made a small game with it)
* **Scikit-learn** (Used in my high school paper on machine learning in drug discovery)
* **NVIM** (Use it for light text editing and easier navigation of files)
* **Cabal** (Used for creating a game in Haskell)

### Non programming tools
* **Mathematics** (including but not limited to calculus, PDE's & ODE's, real and complex analysis, algebra and (abstract) topology; all at undergrad level)
* **MacOS** (Used this operating system for all my life, and know it quite well)   
* **LaTeX and Markdown** (Not much to learn, use it a lot for (acedemic) writing)
* **IMovie** (Can make simple movies and edits for things like assignments)
* **Jira** (Use it for work, and know how to navigate it well enough)
* **Asperite** ( Disclaimer: I am very bad at pixel art :/ )

### Things I'd like to learn
* **Docker** (I've been wanting to get into containerising, so that I can run some FOSS more easily locally for example)
* **Mandarin** (A lot of interesting culture and literature is in Mandarin, and I'm slowly learning the language) 
* **Rust** (Rust sounds like an interesting language, and I'd love to learn it)
* **Bevy** (Part of why I'd like to learn Rust is for the bevy framework, as I love the concepts of ECS)
* **Blender** (I like being creative I suppose)
* **Some web framework** (Not sure yet which one, but I like creating things, and webapps are a thing)
