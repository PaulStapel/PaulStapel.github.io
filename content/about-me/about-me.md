Hiya, I'm Paul! I'm a student-writer-tutor-programmer hybrid specializing in science. This website is my first public project, and I look forward to sharing more of my work in the future. Nonetheless, you can find everything you need to know about me on this page. 

## Currently working on
After summer break is over, I will be following these courses at Utrecht University: 
* Fields and Galois theory
* Functional programming
* Advanced statistical physics
* Multivariable analysis
* Moddeling and system development

\
On the side, I work on this blog and write articles for our student society in [de Vakidioot](https://www.a-eskwadraat.nl/Vereniging/Commissies/vakid/) (BEWARE: Dutch!). 

I also work as a part-time data analyst for Simplex, a Dutch consultancy agency that specialises in AFAS-software. In this job, I desing and develop dashboards with Power Bi.

## Interests
These are some things I really enjoy talking/writing about. I'm always up for a chat!
* Bachelor level Physics, Maths and CompSci
* Education and learning
* Cooking 
* Life-philosophy 
* Books and reading
* Dungeons & Dragons
* (Indie) games
* Anything I blog about
* Any of the skills mentioned below

## Skills
The skills one invests their time in can tell you a lot about someone.

### Languages
* **Python** (data-analysis, scientific computing, algorithmic problem solving)
* **SQL** (Basic database creation and querying)
* **C#** (Basic desktop apps and algorithmic problem solving)
* **HTML & CSS** (Currently learning and improving)
* **Javascript** (Still a beginner, but I'm working on it)
* I also speak Dutch and English, and can comprehend and (poorly) speak German 


### Tools
* **Git and GitHub** (By no means an expert, but I manage quite well)
* **HUGO** (The CMS used for this website, learning more every month)
* **LaTeX and Markdown**
* **ChatGPT** (I consider this, or other LLM's, to be an important tool for our current age)
* **Microsoft Office** (I use it, but always reluctantly)  
* **Power BI** (A great BI tool I use for work. Mostly like it, but we don't always get along)
* **Mathematics** (including but not limited to calculus, PDE's & ODE's, real analysis and algebra)

### Soft skills
 Soft-skills always sounds very subjective to me. If I had asses myself however, I would say that I'm organized, articulate and astute. 

## Reach out
If you want to reach out, you can currently contact me at <contact@paulstapel.com>. I will be making myself easier to reach in the future, so stay tuned. 

Me and my brother also have a wordpress site about Physics. If you want to check it out, [here's the link!](https://phyzards.com). You can also reach me there.
