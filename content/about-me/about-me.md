Hiya, I'm Paul! I'm a student-writer-tutor-programmer hybrid specializing in science. This website is my first public project, and I look forward to sharing more of my work in the future. Nonetheless, you can find everything you need to know about me on this page. 

## Currently working on
After summer break is over, I will be following these courses at Utrecht University: 
* Introduction to topology
* Optimalisation and complexity 
* Advanced quantum mechanics
* Advanced (classical) mechanics
* Functions and series

\
On the side, I work on this blog and write articles for our student society in [de Vakidioot](https://www.a-eskwadraat.nl/Vereniging/Commissies/vakid/) (BEWARE: Dutch!). The vakidioot is currently on hold, but I would like to resume writing for it when time permits.  

I also work as a part-time data analyst for Simplex, a Dutch consultancy agency that specialises in AFAS-software. In this job, I desing and develop dashboards with Power Bi.

## Interests
These are some things I really enjoy talking/writing about. I'm always up for a chat!
* Bachelor level Physics, Maths and CompSci
* Education and learning
* Cooking 
* Life-philosophy 
* Books and reading
* Dungeons & Dragons
* (Indie) games
* Anything I blog about
* Any of the skills mentioned below

## Skills
The skills one invests their time in can tell you a lot about someone.

### Languages
* **Python** (data-analysis, scientific computing, algorithmic problem solving)
* **SQL** (Querying and simple database creation)
* **Haskell** (Basic programming, creating simple games, using monads)
* **C#** (Basic desktop apps, algorithmic problem solving, creating simple games)
* **HTML & CSS** (Basic static webdev like the website you see before you)
* **Bash/Shell** (navigating and mutating files and directories in zsh, more comfortably every day)
* I also speak Dutch and English, and can comprehend and (poorly) speak German 


### Tools
* **Git and GitHub** (By no means an expert, but I manage quite well)
* **HUGO** (The CMS used for this website, learning more every month)
* **VS code** (My IDE of choice, have used for two years now)
* **AvaloniaUI** (Used for creating a simple learning App in C#. Don't love, don't hate)
* **Power BI** (A great BI tool I use for work. Mostly like it so far)
* **.NEt** (All of my c# projects have used the .NET framework)
* **NumPy** (Used for all of my scientific computing in Python)
* **Scikit-learn** (Used in my high school paper on machine learning in drug discovery)
* **Cabal** (Used for creating a game in Haskell)


### Non programming tools
* **Mathematics** (including but not limited to calculus, PDE's & ODE's, real analysis and algebra)
* **Microsoft Office** (I use it, but always reluctantly)  
* **LaTeX and Markdown** (Not much to learn, use it a lot for (acedemic) writing)
* **Jira** (Use it for work, and know how to navigate it well enough)
* **Plane** (A bit like Jira. I use this for managing student projects)
* **Trello** (I use this for scheduling personal projects)
* **MacOS** (Used this operating system for all my life, and know it quite well)
