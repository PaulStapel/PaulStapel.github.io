Hiya, I'm Paul! I'm a student-writer-tutor-programmer hybrid specializing in science. This website is my first public project, and I look forward to sharing more of my work in the future. Nonetheless, you can find everything you need to know about me on this page. 

### Currently working on
I'm currently following four courses at Utrecht University: 
* Databases 
* Fluid dynamics 
* Structure of Matter 
* Real Analysis. 

\
On the side, I work on this blog and write articles for our student society in [de Vakidioot](https://www.a-eskwadraat.nl/Vereniging/Commissies/vakid/) (BEWARE: Dutch!). 

### Interests
These are some things I really enjoy talking/writing about. I'm always up for a chat!
* Bachelor level Physics, Maths and CompSci
* Education and learning
* Cooking 
* Life-philosophy 
* Books and reading
* Dungeons & Dragons
* (Indie) games
* Anything I blog about
* Any of the skills mentioned below

### Skills
The skills one invests their time in can tell you a lot about someone.

#### Languages
* **Python** (data-analysis, scientific computing, algorithmic problem solving)
* **SQL** (Basic database creation and querying)
* **C#** (Basic desktop apps and algorithmic problem solving)
* **HTML & CSS** (Currently learning and improving)
* **Javascript** (Still a beginner, but I'm working on it)
* I also speak Dutch and English, and can comprehend and (poorly) speak German 


#### Tools
* **Git and GitHub** (By no means an expert, but can manage)
* **HUGO** (The CMS used for this website, still learning to better utilize)
* **LaTeX and Markdown** 
* **ChatGPT** (I consider this, or other LLM's, to be an important tool for our current age)
* **Microsoft Office** (I use it, but always reluctantly)  
* **Mathematics** (including but not limited to calculus, PDE's & ODE's, real analysis and algebra)

#### Soft skills
 Soft-skills always sounds very subjective to me. If I had asses myself however, I would say that I'm organized, articulate and astute. 

### Reach out
If you want to reach out, you can currently contact me at <contact@phyzards.com>. I will be making myself easier to reach in the future, so stay tuned. 

Me and my brother also have a wordpress site about Physics. If you want to check it out, [here's the link!](https://phyzards.com). You can also reach me there.
