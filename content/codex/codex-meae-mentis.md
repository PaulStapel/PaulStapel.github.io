In my meditations, I stumble upon thoughts and concepts that cannot always be described fully by language. These thoughts need to be expressed in words that convey feeling, not reason. In my meditations, and throughout my life in general, I may thus share words that are not at all clear in meaning. In order for readers to better understand these concepts, and to keep me from having to repeat myself, I present to you the codex of my mind. 

## Gravedigger
Wikipedia describes a gravedigger as a someone who is responsible for digging a grave prior to a funeral service. In order to create beyond ourselves, we must also be prepared to put ourselves under, and I dub the abstract person that wills their own demise a gravedigger. Not only do these gravediggers dig their own graves, but also those of the concepts and ideas that riddle our society and lives. The gravedigger does not murder, it only wills and prepares for the death of ideas.
