## Today I Learned  
How to use generic structs in C# to create interfaces that don't need an instance of a class to still store information about that class. 

## Thought I Thought
Would a monkey think my phone is a fruit? (hopefully not)

## Today's Media
I started watching "The good place" on Netflix after having it recommended, and read two chapters of "Press reset" (2 more to go).  

## Song Of The Day
Again, it is [Lucky, by TOMOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6W3pvmWmX0)

## Today's Question
What restaurants do I still want to visit? 

## Note To Self
Check if walking routes are closed before planning to go

## A Fascinating World
Fish are able to walk on the streets. They wear shoes as well. If we were to catch one, we would probably eat their fish-shoes as well. I bet their shoes taste like seaweed. 

## Mental Weather
A little tired, but in a relaxed kind of way. 

## Special Thanks To 
The lady at the bus-stop, that told me that the busses didn't go today. I wonder why she was sitting there. 

## What Tomorrow Holds
Tomorrow, I will be picking up my visa, and I will also be doing some more planning so that I can finally leave for Chengdu

## Sacred Snack
Today's sacred snack was the Bak Kut Teh I had for lunch. It was peppery and a little garlicky, although it could have used more garlic in my opinion. Only complaint I have.
