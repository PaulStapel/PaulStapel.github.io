## Today's Question
How do people in China guess the pronunciation of a word they don't know?

## Note To Self
Explore more reading of everyday words in Mandarin. 

## A Fascinating World
In a world where luck could be measured, would this also be something we would compete in? 

## Complaining Corner
I feel a little sick, and sleeping with a stuffed nose is sooooo difficult :(((

## Special Thanks To 
Mah boys that I met at a KTV that sang English songs with me. 

## Sacred Snack
Had some very delicious Sichuan food with my teachers. My Japanese friends also tagged along, which is always nice. The food was quite spicy, but really tasty. I even ate some grilled frogs.
