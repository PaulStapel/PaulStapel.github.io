## Today I Learned  
Some more things about working in the terminal of my computer. 

## Thought I Thought
I should get back to locking in, haha. 

## Today's Media
Watched some YuYu Hakusho again. 

## Song Of The Day
Color your night, big surprise. 

## Today's Question
What shall I do in the evenings after work. Play or creative work? 

## Note To Self
Get back to learning Chinese you fool. 

## A Fascinating World
A world with your personal weather sphere around you would be cool. Getting climate control in a small sphere around you. I think the weather people would choose for themselves can reveal a lot about themselves. Hugging would become like a weather battle with clashing elements or some cool shit. Lightening, go!

## Complaining Corner
My jacket is ripped at the elbow, shit. 

## Mental Weather
Feeling fine, was a bit bored at work, but also just chill vibes. 

## Special Thanks To 
Bas, from work. He's a real nice person to talk to I have noticed. 

## What Tomorrow Holds
Tomorrow, I will start working on university projects. Namely Haskell coding and machine learning. 

## Sacred Snack
Made really good burrito's today, with extra freshness from cilantro and lime. 

## Chinese Homework
Haha I wish.
