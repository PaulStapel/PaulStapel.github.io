## Today I Learned  
How to use MVar and IORef to build concurrent and thread safe programmes in Haskell

## Thought I Thought
Cleaning and drying clothes takes quite some time, but is really relaxing as well. 

## Today's Media
Mostly listening to lofi music. 

## Song Of The Day
Eterna City, Mikel. A lofi remix of a pokemon song. 

## Today's Question
What steps do I need to perform to enroll for a master's degree? 

## Note To Self
I should take more afternoon naps. 

## Complaining Corner
Why can't the sun come up earlier? I hate the fact that it is too dark to wok in the evenings now. 

## Mental Weather
Feeling locked in, worked hard today and felt a nice relaxed flow. 

## Shout-out to
My dad, for arranging for our broken sink to be fixed. 

## What Tomorrow Holds
Tomorrow, I will be having Chinese class. I will go to the barber to get a haircut, and I have volleyball practice. I also wish to finish the assignment for concurrency, as I only need to do just a small part of it. 

## Sacred Snack
Made teriyaki shrimp, done in 30 mins, and very tasty.
