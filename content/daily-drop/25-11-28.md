How does a story become funny? Or in what context. 

## Today's Media
I played Cult of the Lamb with Levi. 

## Song Of The Day
Sinterklaas songs, because we celebrated Sinterklaas at the company

## Today's Question
Am I driving safely enough, or are people on the road just stupid? 

## Note To Self
Don't try to solve other people's problems too much, as it may shift part of the blame on you. 

## A Fascinating World
If all countries got to choose a holiday they wanted to celebrate and have a community to celebrate with, what would be the largest one then?

Why is Windows such a shitty operating system, smh.

Feeling chill after spending the evening chillin' with mah bud Levi. 

## Special Thanks To 
Levi, for inviting me over on a whim. You're a real one.
