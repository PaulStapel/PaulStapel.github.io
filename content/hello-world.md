Welcome to my [blog](https://paulstapel.github.io)! This first post gives a basic overview of what this website is about, and why I started it. 

## Paul's Particles
This is a personal website containing everything I want to share with the world. It is my aim to break these topics down to their fundamentals. In doing so, this website can become a repository of neatly contained packages (particles, if you will) of my knowledge and experience. I try to be as honest as possible in my writing, as this is the most insightful for both me and you. 

## Why did I create this blog? 
I created this blog as a way to document and share my ideas with the world. Building (and perpetually improving) this website gave me good practice with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well. I'm also a strong believer in [showing your work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/) and [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

## Why you should blog as well
Here are some of the best reasons to blog I can think off.  
* It's fun to create and write things other people ~~will~~ might see. 
* It can help you organise your thoughts and ideas.
* Other people can learn from your experience.
* It helps you become more findable online. 
* It's a place to establish your expertise and authority on a subject. 
* It's good practice for both your writing and your coding.

To help with the daunting task of starting a blog, I will write some posts about how I created this website in the future, so stay posted. 

Signing off, have a lovely day!
