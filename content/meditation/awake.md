> As yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile, and to be without jealousy; as yet hath his gushing passion not become calm in beauty. -- Nietzsche

Sometimes, things in life may inspire you to a deeper contemplation. Things that once eluded you suddenly become clearer, and more present in your mind. It can feel as if things just fall in place, and a fire of passion consumes you thus. But it is not that which life reveals to me, but that which life conceals from me that fuels me most. There hangs an innate urge in mankind to dig up all that which is hidden from it; we are a curious bunch. To dig is a noble cause, but those who dig must beware its consequences. As humanity ever carves deeper into world's flesh, world itself becomes ... a graveyard! Oh, how to express that this is devoutly to be wished? And if our knowledge not be sent to the grave, let it be cremated in the flames of our inspiration! 

Let us then hope that one day we become gravekeepers, not gravediggers, and that we may gaze upon Earth, our graveyard, and proclaim: “Wisdom is dead, long live wisdom!”. This north-star has fueled the flames of my inspiration and given the eyes needed to see more clearly what I couldn't see before. What graves will be observed once we have finished digging them? 

As I am thinking more into the order of all life, thoughts start nagging at me like an old woman, and with a similar voice at that. Should not wisdom come with age? Then why does the soul scream that this old wisdom belonges to the grave? Affirmation! It was there all along! The problem with ghosts is that they are invisible, but they haunt us nonetheless. Let the flames of our inspiration burn bright enough to banish them. 

To continue further with this knowledge, we must turn to the own contemplation. The thoughts that elude us most are most worth thinking, and the thoughts least expressable should be our thougths most expressed. Let us then speak the uspeakable, or burn ourselves trying! We should take the world into and out of ourselves at the same time, how else may we both learn from eachother? We are world and world is us! As I speak, I am gushing out into the world the thoughts that I could not express before, and it feels liberating. Yet still it feels like my mouth whispers where my soul screams. There is much more to realise, to think about, and it makes me exalted!
