> Meditation is conversation with the soul. 

For quite some time now, I've been wanting to put more of my creative energy into my blog. To do this, I have tried to understand what makes me me by finding my creative voice. I'm afraid this question is too grand for me to answer in one go. In my life, I have meditated quite often, and this is just one of many other topics I will meditate on in my life. 

Up till now, I have been very introspective in my meditations. This will change with the introduction of my digital garden, a place for me to let my thoughts wander and rest. I will try to regularly meditate here, and I will share my meditations here as well. 

Each of these meditations shall start with a little topic or quote. I urge you to reflect on this topic before reading on, but feel free to read in whatever way you like. These topics will usually have some vague connection to my braindumping, but meditation is a subconcious process, and it may not always lead where you expect it to.
