> “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper” [Adelle Davis]

I'd like to spend more time on my breakfasts. Usually, I cook quite lavishly when it comes to dinner, and I take quite some time to prepare a good meal for lunch, but breakfast has always been left behind a little by me. I'd like to change this soon, but there seem to be some things that stand in my way. These are a feeling that I lack creativity when it comes to the options for cooking breakfast, and a feeling that time could be wasted a little by taking too long on breakfast. 

I should try to let these feelings go such that I take some more time to actually prepare breakfast. If I were to have children later, I would like breakfast to be an even just like dinner would be, in the sense that everyone sits together and eats a fulfilling meal. If this would be my wish onto others, why not wish it onto myself? 

Maybe I'll start by experimenting with breakfast a little more in order to force myself some time to putter in the morning before I get to the things that need to be done. This feeling that I need to get started right away may stem from a feeling that I don't like being left with obligations, but I often find that in its natural movements, nothing is left undone. Then, maybe I should just trust the Way for this, and move at a more natural rythm.
