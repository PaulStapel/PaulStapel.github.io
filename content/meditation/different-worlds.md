> World is as much perception as it is fact [Me]

As we develop and grow older, we come to face many realities. It starts at nothing, nothing to be percieved or thought, an empty slate. From there, we gain insight into the reality around us, our parents, our home, eventually our school. We play pretend, maybe watch some shows, play some games. Through our development, we come into contact with many different worlds. Even as adults, we meet new worlds at work, college, social gatherings, new towns and cities we may move to, countries we visit and the likes.

What can even be considered real? How much realer is life in my home than life in Bangladesh? How much more reality is contained in a 'reality' TV-show than a cartoon? As I advocate extensively, maybe there exists no difference. Can we truly create a scale to measure such a thing? 

In life, I have many facets that constitute my day-to-day life. I study at a university, I go to work at a local company, I exercise in a local gym, I clean around the house, I meet with friends, I take leisurly walks etc. In this, is it not the world that I wish to live in that I can choose to live in? I feel that sometimes we emerse ourselves so much in worlds that mean nothing to us, that we forget to pay attention to those worlds that actually matter. 

Take, then, the world that is most yours, and live it fully, instead of living all of these worlds partly.
