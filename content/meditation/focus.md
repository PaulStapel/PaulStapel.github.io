> "If you want to complete a project, maximise the time you spend sat on your chair" [Jonathon Blow]

During this summer, I've been doing quite some work at the company I work for. Along with all the social obligations and events, it tired me out quite a bit. I got to do what I wanted to do, but I did notice that I noticed that I struggled staying focussed on what is important to me. Because of this, I wanted to do some reflection on focus, and how to get things done. 

For starters, I notice that sitting down and just starting is one of the best ways to get things done. Once I get in a groove, most of the work follows naturally. During normal weeks, this is no problem, but when I do stuff that tires me out, it is quite a bit harder to get to that point of sitting down at your desk. 

Todo lists are one thing that has helped me get things done. Simply knowing what it is that you want to get done can help actually get those things done. The less we have to think, the less distractions can pop up in our heads. It is quite simple really.

With some of my projects, I have noticed that getting things done is also tied closely to my enjoyment of the process. In order to get working, you need to work on things you enjoy, lest you burn yourself out. Finding things you enjoy takes some time, but you can hack the process by combining tasks you are not sure of with rewards that you enjoy. For example, drinking some maté to me is a strong motivator in sitting down. The aroma is just sublime. We need to always remember what we live for, and life is too short not to be kind to yourself. 

Jonathon Blow defines burn-out as what happens when you put a lot of effort into something you do not totally love. It is your subconcious saying that the work is not worth the amount of effort you put into it. I can find myself strongly in this, and think it is a very nice definition. I'd say that staying focussed, you need to absolutely love what you are doing. 

To myself: Keep in mind that when you go for a run, you usually feel tired around 50% of the way. Still, you have energy left for the other 50%. It is the same way with all endevours in life. Trust in yourself to have the energy to truly produce something, and don't let the energy levels you feel limit the energy levels you have.
