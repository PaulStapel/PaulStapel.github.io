> "The right way to go easy is to forget the right way" [Zhuangzi]

I was looking at my blog, and found that some of the posts where set to draft. I forgot to post them, but ah well, it doesn't really matter. I will be posting them soon, I think -- otherwise all posts will just be uploaded today, and that would be strange. 

Forgetting is quite an interesting thing. We are scared to forget, but at the same time, it is something that helps us move on in life. It helps us keep our minds clean, and it helps us see things in a new perspective. There is pain in forgetting, and having to let go, but also a relief. It is a weird feeling, a feeling that tastes of grapefruits and freshly picked blackberries.

An empty mind is a happy mind -- oh how this contrasts with the analytical mind inside of me. But yes, forgetting is the ultimate goal... To achieve "wu wei", a state of doing nothing and holding on to nothing and thus achieving everything. 

Anyway, while on the topic of forgetting. One of my favorite songs by the rock duo Yorushika is entitled "忘れてください", which translates to "forget it". Besides the bitter-sweet melody of this song, and the amazing flow that it has, I really love the lyrics of this song. Here is an excerpt translated to English:

"In a small house within a box
There’s the kitchen where we stood side by side
And beyond the curtain at the small window
There’s the garden of memories
So bury a piece of spring sunlight there
And give a little water once in a while until it grows
And bears a small loquat
Then, forget it, please"

One of my favorite songs. 

Anyway, that's all for today -- Go easy!
