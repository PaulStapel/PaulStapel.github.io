> Falling down is an accident, staying down is a choice

When working on becoming the person you want to be, it is often in the stressful and doubtful situations that you find out your conviction is strong. You can tell alot about yourself and your growth as a person from how you deal with hardship, however small it may be. 

It is good excercise to ask yourself what your instinctual reaction is when something goes wrong. For me, I usually get quite defensive, trying to either shift the blame or talk my way out of it. For me, the first step in growth is recognising this harmful behaviour. The next step is to correct it when I notice it happening. The final step would be to let go of this behaviour altogether. 

I have often struggled with making mistakes. I would loathe myself for my own faults, and as a result I would lose control whenever they occured. This kept me from correcting my behaviour and becoming the calm and collected person I wanted to be.
