> Bathing in the morning sun, not only can we feel a presence of mind, but also a presence of God [Me]

What a luxery it would be to have your window aligned with the sunrise. When spring slowly turns into summer, one of the most inspiring changes is that the sunrise is brought to us earlier and earlier. When I awake, I tend to become most energetic at sunrise, and this means that my sleep schedule also shifts earlier into the day. As the sun gently wakes me up, I awake without the need for an alarm -- ah what a wonderful feeling natural waking is. 

It is truly a blessing to be able to enjoy such peaceful mornings, slowly going about your day without a care in the world, trusting fully that whatever needs to be done in a day will be done in due time. In such mornings, the mind rids itself from all fog and thus becomes empty, a vassal for Self / God / Way. At such a sacred time, we must walk as if crossing the largest of temples, and act as if performing the holiest of rituals. By doing nothing, leave nothing undone. 

How blessed I am that I can awake, bathe in the sun, stretch my stiff body, get clothed and comfortable, take my first sip of water (the best sip of water), brush my teeth, fuel my body, enjoy a cup of tea and look forward to my day. As much as it is a privilege, it is also a way of Mind and Body and Soul. 

Take your time to observe your blessings each and every day. Waking up is like coming alive again, and if being alive is filled with blessing, waking up is a holy ritual.
