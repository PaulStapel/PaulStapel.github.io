2024 was a good year for me. It was a year of great fortune in my education, work and home life. That being said, I have even more to look forward to in 2025, and one of the things I always embrace in the new year is the opportunity to steer myself in the right direction along the tracks of life. Today, I will discuss the things I would like to improve upon when it comes to my body, mind and soul in 2025. 

## Body
I am no stranger to excercise. I do (almost) daily stamina training by running or skipping rope, and I also do regular bodyweight excercise at home. I am, however, noticing one thing that I would like to have more of: flexibility. 

I do daily yoga at home, but these sessions are incredibly short, and really only used for me to get my muscles moving when I step out of bed. In order for me to get more comfortable in my own body, it would be beneficial if I did more stretching than I am doing now.

In order to achieve this goal, I will try to expand upon my daily habit of stretching in order to incorporate longer yoga sessions into my daily routine. 

This has the added benefit of allowing more time to putter in the morning, such that I can get some of my other daily activities done in a more relaxed fashion. I have a (bad) habit of working for too long, and it would be nice if I have more incentive to postpone my work. 

## Mind
When it comes to my intellectual needs, I would like to work on my memory. I have yet to find a good way for me to remember some details when it comes to the people around me, and I would like to train my memory and employ better systems in order to keep remembering some of these things. 

## Soul
When it comes to my social life, this is the most important resolution for me. I am currently spending quite some time at home because of my studying, and as such, it is sometimes hard to find the time to speak with the people I love and care about. I would love to take this year to get more involved in my relationships, and to spend more time at university, work and with friends so that I can improve my social skills and friendships. 

I will have to think more in depth about the ways in which I would like to improve my social skills, but I will start by going to university and work more often. 

Those are all of my resolutions for 2025. I would love to hear about your resolutions as well, so feel free to mail me at contact@paulstapel.com, or reach out on social media <3
