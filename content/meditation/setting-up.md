> [Donald Knuth] "Premature optimization is the root of all evil"

Sometimes, I struggle with getting started on things because there are too many options for the set-up. Maybe this is because no real best way to do something is known, or maybe it is because there are too many good options available, but it leaves me a little paralysed afraid of heading down the wrong rabbit hole. 

I meditated a little on this, and wanted to share two things that have helped me in this. Firstly, I need to accept that failing often is the best way to go (flywheel of becoming). Instead of going for the "most logical" or "most suitable" option, I should first go with the option with which I vibe the most. After that, I can always decide to switch if I find that something is wrong with the way I'm doing things now. Secondly, I should allow myself only a fixed set of time to work on making decisions when it comes to the set-up

In doing this, I get around to doing the things that are actually important to me: learning and creating. I have often struggled with analysis paralysis, and this is just another manifestation of this monster. May it be banished henceforth.
