> Winter is a slow heartbeat, an aged murmur of lifelong love   -- Angie Weiland-Crosby

During these cold winter months, it is easy to let the mind slow down to a halt. The combination of cold temperature and short days makes for a season of tiredness, but also of tranquility. I wanted to take this slow afternoon to reflect on this beautiful January, and to shape my winter ways. 

## Staying lively
Winter is a numb season. The trees and flowers that promptly die, the frost that paints our windows and the cold winds that chill us to the bone all exemplify this. How then, must we keep our spirit bright when all around us is white and gray? Can we manage to see this blank canvas of a world as a contrast to our own colors all the more? Laugh then! Let not only the sun reflect on your teeth as it does on the snow, but let this laugh itself become sun. 

The good vibes that we feel produce summer, not the other way around! Let then our warmth come from the joy we feel from the work we do and the vibes we produce! Take this winter to be extra proud, extra determined and extra extra. If we don't keep moving, we will be frozen solid, so fuel your fire!

## Reflecting in the snow
Of course, we must also listen to mother nature. It must be for a reason that the winter slows everything down. Winter is a season of reflection. Take this time to adjust your course and reignite your passions, it is nature's great reset. 

Nothing as tranquil as the crisp morning air of winter. Then let your mind follow you in your walks of meditation, and let the winter inspire you so. Allow yourself time to take things slow. Even the most pristine snowflake feels no urgency; it reveals itself to us in its own time.

## The balance
Do I contradict myself? It is not up to me to contradict myself on this matter; I'll leave that up to the interpretation. As for me (however paradoxical it may seem), I believe we can burn with passion while staying cool about it. Let us strive for this then.
