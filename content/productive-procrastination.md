Productive procrastination is the art of delaying the task you need to get done by doing other (often less important) tasks that need to be done. Now, I've heard many different takes on this habit, and have taken different stances depending through the years. Today, I will break down some of its benefits and problems. I will also discuss some alternative methods. 

### The good

#### Momentum
When doing work, you should aim to stay in motion. Once I've been going for a while, I often find myself entering a flow state wherein I lose any sense of time. THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE WHEN DOING PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING. When you stop doing productive work, by checking your socials, or watching funny memes for example, this state is lost as well. In contrast, procrastinating on other productive tasks still lets mee keep some of the momentum I've built up, making it easier to start on my main TODO. 

#### Easily missed tasks get done
Keeping a backlog of tasks to procrastinate on helps me clear those pesky tasks that I always seem to forget. These tasks, like cleaning my laptop, organizing my notes or updating my calendar are often perfect for short procrastinations. Without the backlog, these tasks wouldn't be on my radar as often. 

#### It's better than just procrastinating
This one is quite obvious. When you can't summon the willpower to actually do the work you need, getting SOME work done is always better than nothing. 

#### Increased motivation and creativity
When mixing tasks throughout the day, you can stay motivated more by mixing up your work. An added benefit is that this increases creativity. I have found that a fresh pair of eyes often helps making things clearer, and results in me thinking more creative thoughts. Interweaving work can also make it easier to create mental links. 

### The bad

#### Overworking
Of course, taking a break is important, and this method can easily lead to a mindset of perpetual working. This is why you should always differentiate the time when you should work but don't want to, and the time that you actually want to relax. The main take-away is that normal procrastination often has you "semi-relaxing" when you want to be working, and this should be avoided. 

#### Important tasks get pushed aside
Of course, you can procrastinate productively all you want, but at the end of the day, you're still delaying your actual tasks. If this is kept up, you're still in trouble. I find that is can be just as easy to procrastinate this way, and though this makes it easy to implement, it also makes it hard to eat that frog. 

#### False sense of progress
Tying into the last point, a final pitfall of productive procrastination is how it gives you a feeling of doing good work, when in reality you are still somewhat wasting your time.
