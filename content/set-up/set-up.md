Here you can find my current setup with regards to desk, hardware, software and the likes. I often find it useful to read what other people are using and how they stay organized, so in this post I will return the favor. 

## My workspace
For my workspace, I sit at an Ikea Lagkapten desk, which I like to keep clean and minimal. On it, I have my laptop, a pen, a Harte Ikea LED-lamp and my (bullet) journal. I usually work with two screens, so I also have an LG-screen mounted on the wall. Next to this desk, I have an Alex Ikea drawer. I it on a Yaasa 'vital' chair to support my back during my long study sessions. 

## Hardware
* M2 MacBook Pro (daily driver | OS: MacOS 14 Sonoma)
* iPhone SE 2020 (For organization, communication and information look-up)
* Nintendo Switch (gaming)

## Software
These are software I use on a regular basis. I may write a blog about af few of these, as I've put quite some thought into choosing them. 
* Apple mail, notes, and Safari (I enjoy the simplicity of these apps)
* VScode (My favorite text editor because of the ease of customization it provides)
* Github (Because I have to share my code with fellow students quite often) 
* Google Calendar (I really like the UI of this calendar-app)
* Overleaf (For LaTeX collaboration, this is the most intuitive option)
* Excalidraw (For quickly noting done diagrams or sketching ideas)
* ChatGPT (For code-review and time-saving applications)
* Stack exchange (For when I need specific answers)
* Leetcode and FreeCodeCamp (For self-studying coding)

## Miscellaneous
Besides these, here are some things I use regularly that I really recommend. 
* A ball pen from Cross
* A chair phone-holder from Ikea (the Krubbet)
* A Kobo Clara E-reader (reading E-books and PDF's)
