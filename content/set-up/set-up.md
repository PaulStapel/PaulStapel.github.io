Here you can find my current setup with regards to desk, hardware, software and the likes. I often find it useful to read what other people are using and how they stay organized, so in this post I will return the favor. 

## My workspace
For my workspace, I sit at a 160x80 cm Ikea Mittzon desk, which I like to keep clean by wiping it with a wet cloth every so often. On it, I have my laptop, a pen, a coaster and mug, a Diginut W-125 15W 3IN1 foldable wireless charger and a Harte Ikea LED-lamp. I usually work with three screens, so I also have two LG-screens on my desk. Next to this desk, I have an Ikea Alex drawer. I sit on a Yaasa 'vital' chair to support my back during my long study sessions.

## Hardware
* M4 MacBook Pro:  24 GB RAM | 12-core CPU | 16-core GPU | 16-core neural engine | 512 GB SSD | 14-inch display. After some research I found this to be the best bang for your buck when it comes to m4 chips. (daily driver | OS: MacOS 15 Sequoia)
* iPhone 16 base model (For organization, communication, music, information look-up and some light gaming)
* Airpods 1 (I listen to a lotttt of music)
* Nintendo Switch (for gaming)

## Software
These are software I use on a regular basis. I may write a blog about af few of these, as I've put quite some thought into choosing them. 
* Apple mail, notes, reminders and Safari (I enjoy the simplicity of these apps)
* Raycast (better spotlight, very powerful and customisable)
* Homebrew (package manager for mac, and very useful for exporting to a new device.)
* VScode (My favorite text editor because of the ease of customization it provides)
* Iterm2 (my terminal of choice for its ease of customisation and ability to split multiple panes)
* Github and gh desktop (Because I have to share my code with fellow students quite often, and a GUI can sometimes help organise this more cleanly.) 
* Apple Calendar (I really like the UI of this calendar-app)
* Overleaf (For LaTeX collaboration, this is the most intuitive option)
* Excalidraw (For quickly noting done diagrams or sketching ideas)
* ChatGPT (For code-review and time-saving applications like generating boilerplate code)
* Stack exchange (For when I need specific answers or want to help people learn)
* Aseprite (for creative persuits and pixelart creation for things like games)
* Discord and whatsapp (for communication with peers)
* Spotify (for its wide selection of LoFi and game music)
* Leetcode (For self-studying coding)

## Miscellaneous
Besides these, here are some things I use regularly that I really recommend. 
* A ball pen from Cross
* A chair phone-holder from Ikea (the Krubbet)
* A Kobo Clara E-reader (reading E-books and PDF's)
