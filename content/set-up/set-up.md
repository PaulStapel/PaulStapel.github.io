Here you can find my current setup with regards to desk, hardware, software and the likes. I often find it useful to read what other people are using and how they stay organized, so in this post I will return the favor. 

### My workspace
For my workspace, I sit at an Ikea Lagkapten desk, which I like to keep clean and minimal. On it, I have my laptop, a pen, a Harte Ikea LED-lamp and my journal. I usually work with two screens, so I also have an LG-screen mounted on the wall. Next to this desk, I have an Alex Ikea drawer.

### Hardware
* M2 MacBook Pro (daily driver | OS: MacOS 14 Sonoma)
* LG monitor
* Iphone SE 2020 (For organization, communication and information look-up)
* Nintendo Switch (gaming)
* Kobo Clara E-reader (reading E-books and PDF's)

### Software
