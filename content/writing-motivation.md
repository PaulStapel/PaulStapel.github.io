So, I have struggled with a lack of motivation to write. Sometimes, I can be to perfectionistic to get anything done, while at other times I simply have to much going on in my head and I feel like I just can't find the time to write. Whatever the reason may be, it's unwarranted more often than not. This does not make the act of sitting down and simply writing any easier of course. That's why I wanted to share some of the ways I make writing (motivation) easier for myself. 


## When I write

I usually work well when I have a rhythm to my day. For writing, I find that I am more creative in the evenings, as my brain has been working for a while, and I can't really focus on demanding tasks like coding or doing maths anymore. By knowing the evening is a time for writing and being creative, I can enter my writing mode better. I usually force myself to write at least a paragraph per day in the evening. That way, I always keep up the good habit while not asking too much of myself. Usually, I enter the zone and keep writing, but I also allow myself to just not feel up to it and write only a little. 

An added benefit of writing in the evening is that I can write down my recipes right after diner, so that recipe is still fresh in my memory. Similarly, if you were to write about university, doings so immediately after coming home from the campus would be a way to channel the excitement of your day towards your writing. In general, I only write about things that excite me, so riding the wave of excitement is the best way to stay motivated. Whenever I learn something cool or when inspiration strikes me like hot lightening, I try to write it down as soon as possible.

## What I write about

So, the topics you want to write about are also very important for motivation. I have a few rules when it comes to this:

Rule 1: Don't make your writing your work (unless it IS your work)
Rule 2: Don't make your work your writing 
Rule 3: Don't lock into one specific topic, give yourself the freedom to write whatever you want to write
Rule 4: Write about things you don't need to research from scratch (at the beginning at least)
