      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t bake often, but from time to time, I really enjoy filling my pantry with some sweet deliciousness. This brownie recipe is one of my favs when it comes to that purpose. You can store this brownie for later, but even better would be to scoop them right out of the pan and eat it while it&amp;rsquo;s hot.&#xA;Ingredients 220 grams sugar 120 grams butter 80 grams all-purpose flower 3 or 4 eggs (3 if you want it fudgy, 4 if you like them more solid) 60 grams cacao powder A little bit of salt Optional vanilla extract Optional chocalate chips or chunks Optional whipped cream for serving Baking plan Start by heating an oven to about 180 degrees Celcius.</description>

      <description>At first, I was planning on making scones. Because of a lack of better moulds, I decided to use a muffin tray, and the rest is history. This recipe yields about 12 medium-sized scuffins.&#xA;Ingredients 500 grams of all-purpose flour 200 grams of granulated sugar About 10 grams of baking powder 2 eggs 250 grams of butter 200 grams of crème fraîche About 20 milliliters of milk About 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract A pinch of salt Optionally, toppings like milk chocolate, blueberries or caramel A muffin tray Baking plan Preheat an oven to 200 degrees Celsius.</description>
