      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I have slowly been working on a game lately, and I wanted to share some of the problems I face and my solutions to those problems. I find that a definitive guide to input handling was something I could not really find online, and although input handling can be done in simple ways, I&amp;rsquo;d like to make a system to make it more robust and extensible. I wanted to share my findings and opinions here, as I have found that there is not enough information about this topic online. If you have any feedback, or if you would implement things differently, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear about it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
