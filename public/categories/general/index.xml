      <title>How I Get Things Done</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can have a lot on my plate sometimes. Work, university, content creation, home organisation, a social life (who&amp;rsquo;da thunk?) and personal projects all vie for my attention. Amidst all this chaos, I need a way to stay organised while staying flexible enough to enable spontaneity in life, as the best things can come unexpectedly. I would like to share my considerations and results in this (p)article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;down-with-convoluted-workflows&#34;&gt;Down with convoluted workflows&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my younger years, when I was still trying to find out what worked best for me, I was enamored by the world of productivity books and videos. These people would talk about second brains, task automations and productivity apps, all with the promise of making you a productivity beast that would never forget anything ever again. Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy it entirely, it started me down a rabbit hole of increasingly complex workflows, that eventually made me realise that you&amp;rsquo;d need a full-time job to even so much as sustain such a system; No thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://paulstapel.github.io&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;! This first post gives a basic overview of what this website is about, and why I started it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;pauls-particles&#34;&gt;Paul&amp;rsquo;s Particles&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a personal website containing everything I want to share with the world. It is my aim to break these topics down to their fundamentals. In doing so, this website can become a repository of neatly contained packages (particles, if you will) of my knowledge and experience. I try to be as honest as possible in my writing, as this is the most insightful for both me and you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
