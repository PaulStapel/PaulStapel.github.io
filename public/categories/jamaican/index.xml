      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I combined my love for Jamaican food and inventing new foods to come up with a delicious take on jerk chicken. The result is this simple recipe that consists of simply grilling the chicken and then broiling it in the flavorsome jerk sauce. I usually serve this with a baguette, as the sauce is just heavenly for dipping.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am trying to experiment with measurements, as I&amp;rsquo;ve had quite some people approach me saying they would like to know exactly how much to add of each ingredient. Keep in mind that I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly measure my ingredients, and that these measurements are thus geusstimates of how much I usually add.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
