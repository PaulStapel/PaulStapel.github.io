      <title>My Experience with Romance</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it - all idealism is mandaciousness in the face of what is necessary - but love it&amp;rdquo; [Friedrich Nietzsche]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I have stated last week, love is a troubling subject to me. It has taken many a nights of pondering this abstract topic for me to even discover my feelings on it, and only after a relationship of about two years have I grasped them in some capacity. One of the greatest findings has been that I actually don&amp;rsquo;t feel a strong need for romantic love. I would like to bring some nuance to these thoughts of mine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Silent Observation</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Poetry should be great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one&amp;rsquo;s soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself, but with its&#xA;subject&amp;rdquo; [John Keats]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could ask myself to think about the way I am breathing currently. It is often joked that this makes you start to think too much about your breathing, making you switch from automatic breathing to manual breathing. I have been reading &amp;ldquo;The Art of Game Design&amp;rdquo; by Jesse Schell, and in one of the earlier chapters, he talks about the paradox of actually observing your experiences. If we want to learn our thoughts about a certain experience, it would be best to observe our own thoughts while we are still experiencing it, as it is much harder to bring back those feelings after the fact. The quantum-mechanics-like problem we face here is that the act of observing our experience disturbs it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Post Mortem of First Love</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The saddest thing about love is not only that it cannot last forever, but that heartbreak is soon forgotten&amp;rdquo; [William Faulkner]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last December, I broke up with my first serious partner. We had been together for 2 years by then, but we both agreed that it would be better for us to go our own ways. As it has now been 5 months already, I felt it was finally time to write down some of my meditations that came from this breakup. I was hesitant to post things too soon, as it could have been interpreted as either spiteful or bitter to post about my past relationship so soon after it ended. Of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean this post to be any of those things, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to reiterate that there has been no bad blood between us &amp;lt;3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Defeat is a state of mind; no one is ever defeated until defeat has been accepted as a reality&amp;rdquo; [Bruce Lee]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday marked the end of my most recent semester of university, and one of the most challenging semesters yet. I was faced with the mountain that was the course &amp;ldquo;topology and geometry&amp;rdquo;, a course on abstract topology. If you are interested in reading my original thoughts on this course, &lt;a href=&#34;https://paulstapel.com/meditation/facing-mountains/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d refer you to this post&lt;/a&gt;, where I shared my anxieties going into this semester. Just having finished the exam yesterday, I am happy to announce that I passed this and all other courses generously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Rejecting the Self</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/meditation/on-rejecting-the-self/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/meditation/on-rejecting-the-self/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh, you sentimental hypocrites, you lustful men! You lack innocence in desire: and therefore you now slander desiring!&amp;rdquo;  [Nietzsche]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After re-reading Nietzsche&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Of immaculate perception&amp;rdquo;, I started seeing some of the subjects of resentment more clearly. It is all too common to reject our own nature, and resent our love and desire in this world for we lack a certain innocence in this desiring. We can be a jealous bunch, afraid of our own desires. It is like a child throwing a tantrum, saying that if they can&amp;rsquo;t have it, nobody can. Instead of little fists, we wave around morals and values.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Company And Solitude</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/meditation/on-company-and-solitude/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 21:48:14 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/meditation/on-company-and-solitude/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My solitude doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on the presence or absence of people; on the contrary, I hate who steals my solitude without, in exchange, offering me true company&amp;rdquo; [Nietzsche]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solitude is a tricky thing. On the one hand, I strive to find peace in solitude, and the time I spend with myself is among the most peaceful time I can have. On the other, I recognise that a certain balance needs to be struck between relying on friends and relying on self. Both love of your neighbours and love of solitude can come from resentment of yourself. Truly, our company can be solitude when it is an escape from the self, for how can we be present if we have fled? And similarly, our solitude can become numbing if the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; escapes the self, for how can we feel if we have fled?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Awake</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile, and to be without jealousy; as yet hath his gushing passion not become calm in beauty [Nietzsche]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, things in life may inspire you to a deeper contemplation. Things that once eluded you suddenly become clearer, and more present in your mind. It can feel as if things just fall in place, and a fire of passion consumes you thus. But it is not that which life reveals to me, but that which life conceals from me that fuels me most. There hangs an innate urge in mankind to dig up all that which is hidden from it; we are a curious bunch. To dig is a noble cause, but those who dig must beware its consequences. As humanity ever carves deeper into world&amp;rsquo;s flesh, world itself becomes &amp;hellip; a graveyard! Oh, how to express that this is devoutly to be wished? And if our knowledge not be sent to the grave, let it be cremated in the flames of our inspiration!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Crushing Weight of Time</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The past wants to be loved, the future heard and the present lived - such is the nature of time&amp;rdquo; [Me]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are subject to much force throughout our lives. I myself can feel this resistance in much of what I do. A principle I try to live by is to follow the path of least resistance - to go with the flow of the way of life. I also believe that life is what you make of it, and that our actions shape these paths for our future. Living with only the present in mind, while admirable, may lead to greater resistance down the line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On the mountains of truth you can never climb in vain; either you will reach a point higher up today, or you will be training so that you will be able to climb higher tomorrow&amp;rdquo; [Nietzsche]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last academic period didn&amp;rsquo;t go easy on me. Or more accurately, I didn&amp;rsquo;t go easy on myself. I always aim to challenge myself, and with all the things that I had to do outside of studying I found myself struggling quite a bit more than previous periods. This, i believe, is a good thing, as it means that I am slowly approaching my limit and finding new ways to challenge myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Slow Days of January</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Winter is a slow heartbeat, an aged murmur of lifelong love&amp;rdquo; [Angie Weiland-Crosby]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During these cold winter months, it is easy to let the mind slow down to a halt. The combination of cold temperature and short days makes for a season of tiredness, but also of tranquility. I wanted to take this slow afternoon to reflect on this beautiful January, and to shape my winter ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;staying-lively&#34;&gt;Staying lively&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Winter is a numb season. The trees and flowers that promptly die, the frost that paints our windows and the cold winds that chill us to the bone all exemplify this. How then, must we keep our spirit bright when all around us is white and gray? Can we manage to see this blank canvas of a world as a contrast to our own colors all the more? Laugh then! Let not only the sun reflect on your teeth as it does on the snow, but let this laugh itself become sun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conversations are like fishing</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Life is a conversation, make it a good one&amp;rdquo; [Glennon Doyle]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In keeping with my new year resolutions, I started meditating on how I can become a more sociable person. One of the core parts of being social is conversation, and while I have learned a lot about how to hold an engaging conversation, there is always one thing that I find difficult: How do you start a conversation in a natural way?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I may run a marathon</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Once you make the decision that you will not fail, the heart and body will follow&amp;rdquo; [Kara Goucher]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So a few friends of mine came up with the idea to run a marathon in 2026. Now, I have been running for about 4 months, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have imagined doing this 1 year ago. I wanted to share some of my personal observations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-physical-confidence&#34;&gt;My physical confidence&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my youth, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t always the fittest person. Some could say I was a little chubby, or more bluntly, quite fat. I was bad at sports and couldn’t run a mile if my life depended on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was a year of great fortune in my education, work and home life. That being said, I have even more to look forward to in 2025, and one of the things I always embrace in the new year is the opportunity to steer myself in the right direction along the tracks of life. Today, I will discuss the things I would like to improve upon when it comes to my body, mind and soul in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Noticing My Bad Habits</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Every battle is won before it is fought&amp;rdquo; [Sun Tzu]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my life, I have noticed that most of my failings are only recognized in hindsight. It is often easier to look back with an analytical mind than to analyze the situation on the fly. This is exactly why I mostly fall victim to my unwillingness to say no when I am put on the spot. From my experience, the best way to shift this bad habit is to analyze the course of action beforehand. Luckily, I already have some systems in place that make it easier for me to act more mindfully, and the implementation of these tricks is exactly what this meditation was centered around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning To Say No</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have to learn to say no to many good things if you want to say yes to many great things&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have found myself having trouble saying no to people. Of course, when push comes to shove, I know when to stand my ground when I strongly believe in something, but the main problem lies in saying no to good things. In order to explore this, I will take you on a journey of meditation where I explore this side of myself for the first time. That&amp;rsquo;s right, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a certified &amp;ldquo;Paul character arc&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In those times, my studying routine works, my workout routine works, I&amp;rsquo;m being social and am taking care of myself and the people around me. Then, something happens that knocks me off-balance. This summer, it has been a wonderful vacation to Vietnam that saw me quickly adapt my way of living to this travelling lifestyle, but this sweeping force may also be something a little less enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Falling down is an accident, staying down is a choice&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When working on becoming the person you want to be, it is often in the stressful and doubtful situations that you find out your conviction is strong. You can tell alot about yourself and your growth as a person from how you deal with hardship, however small it may be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is good excercise to ask yourself what your instinctual reaction is when something goes wrong. For me, I usually get quite defensive, trying to either shift the blame or talk my way out of it. For me, the first step in growth is recognising this harmful behaviour. The next step is to correct it when I notice it happening. The final step would be to let go of this behaviour altogether.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beauty exists only to relief us from ugliness&amp;rdquo; [Oscar Wilde]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often in live, I find myself feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m above the need for beauty. It can be seen as a virtue to look not at appearance but at what lies within. I agree with this, but only recently have I come around to realising that beauty has its place as well. A lack of elegance or beauty can be distracting. This distraction may take some effort to look through, ultimately draining (a slight amount of) energy.Oppositely, beauty can also motivate and invigorate the mind. It can be seen as a way of seeing beauty in the world and embracing the effect it has on you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To do this, I have tried to understand what makes me me by finding my creative voice. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid this question is too grand for me to answer in one go. In my life, I have meditated quite often, and this is just one of many other topics I will meditate on in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
