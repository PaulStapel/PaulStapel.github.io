      <description>&lt;p&gt;About 9 in 10 people in the world can read. Crazy, considering just 100 years ago this number barely exceeded 2 in 10. Talking about reading, I was doing some of that just now. I was looking into Sichuan cooking because I wanted to make something nice for diner, until I noticed something annoying. EVERY SINGLE COOKING BLOG PLACES THEIR RECIPE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m no stranger to the internet and have done some research into SEO and all that, but this nuisance did spark some thoughts in me that I wanted to write down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
