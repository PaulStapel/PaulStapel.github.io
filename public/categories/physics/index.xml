      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently taking a course on field theory, and we are currently working with Lorentz transformations and the likes. I have never really liked the way lorentz transformations are introduced, as previously, they weren&amp;rsquo;t derived that much, and we just had to take them for granted. The book we are currently working with is also a bit lackluster when it comes to the full derivation of lorentz transformations and the likes, and so I wanted to give this derivation a shot to see if I could explain it in a more intuitive way. Let&amp;rsquo;s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical Mechanics Three Ways</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Classical mechanics is a very useful tool in describing the world around us. As I am currently taking a course about classical mechanics, I wanted to give a quick overview of the three main ways in which a classical problem can be solved in physics. We will also work through a simple example using the simple pendulum with mass $m$ and length $l$. This article will take you through the main steps you&amp;rsquo;ll have to take to tackle a problem and the derivation of the different methods. Without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
