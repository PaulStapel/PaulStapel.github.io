      <description>Hiya, long time no see! It&amp;rsquo;s been - glances at notes - more than 100 days since I last posted something on Paul&amp;rsquo;s Particles. A lot has happened, but I&amp;rsquo;m finally starting to settle into my usual routine again. I&amp;rsquo;ve got some great content planned, but I thought I would start things off with a simple post sharing what my phone looks like. I actually hide all apps that are not on my home screen in order to avoid distractions from social media apps or apps that I just don&amp;rsquo;t use on a daily basis, meaning my home screen is like a best-of collection for my phone.</description>

      <title>How I get motivation to write</title>

      <description>So, I have struggled with a lack of motivation to write. Sometimes, I can be to perfectionistic to get anything done, while at other times I simply have to much going on in my head and I feel like I just can&amp;rsquo;t find the time to write. Whatever the reason may be, it&amp;rsquo;s unwarranted more often than not. This does not make the act of sitting down and simply writing any easier off course.</description>

      <description>Productive procrastination is the art of delaying the task you need to get done by doing other (often less important) tasks that need to be done. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard many different takes on this habit, and have taken different stances through the years. Today, I will break down some of the benefits and problems. I will also discuss some alternative methods.&#xA;The good Momentum When doing work, you should aim to stay in motion.</description>

      <description>As I have stated in my setup-page, I use VScode as my main text editor. I especially like the ability to customize your coding environment with extensions. Today, I will share the extensions that really give a boost to my work.&#xA;Better Comments This first extension allows me to better manage and organize my annotations while coding. When starting comments with alerts (!), questions (?), TODO&amp;rsquo;s (TODO), or important tags (*), this extension automatically colors them to make them stand out more.</description>
