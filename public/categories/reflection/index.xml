      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t learn from experience, we learn from reflecting on experience [John Dewey]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed at university. This is my third year I partook in, and my second year on paper. Three down, one to go. I have done quite a lot this year, and I wish to reflect on a few things. For this meditation, I reflect on my favorite thing I learned for each subject this year. One abstract thing, and one concrete thing. With a total of 17 subjects taken, I will go over each one only briefly. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to give a grade to each course based on how useful and interesting the course was (scale 1-5).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
