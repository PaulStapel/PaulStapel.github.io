      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yep, that&amp;rsquo;s right. I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new category of posts on my blog. I wanted to create an outlet for all of the wonderful media I consume. Be it games, books, films, courses or even music, everything I would like to share my opinion on will be gathered in this part of my website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To start things off, I wanted to talk about my game of choice for this winter. Yes, yes, everyone has already talked about this game plenty, but I really really enjoyed this game, which is why I would now like to review: Balatro.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
