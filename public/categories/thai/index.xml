      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years back, I had a trip to Thailand with my family. While there, we ate a lot of very delicious food, and I have been recreating the things I ate there quite often.&#xA;One thing that does bug me about doing this, however, is the fact that some of the ingredients can be quite troublesome to acquire. Not today however, as we will be making larb.&#xA;The ingredients used for this are quite easy to come by in your local Asian supermarket or even just the grocery store. Serve with rice, naan or even tortilla&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
