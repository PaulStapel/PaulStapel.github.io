      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so as my blog has been growing recently, I decided it was about time I started implementing some more features. One of the things I wanted to add was a little floating table of contents. From there, users would be able to more easily navigate through a given page, and as I have just recently implemented my &lt;a href=&#34;https://paulstapel.com/codex/codex-meae-mentis/&#34;&gt;codex&lt;/a&gt;, I felt it was about time to create this. As I found it rather difficult to find things about this online, I wanted to quickly share my implementation. I will be using HTML, Javascript and CSS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
