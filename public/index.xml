      <description>The only way to make a good dish even gooder is to add an exuberant amount of garlic to it. That was exactly the premise of this little experiment. Adding a lot of garlic and seeing where it leads me. It turned out to be a delightful recipe that I have even decided to share her on my blog. Be warned, not for the faint of heart.&#xA;Ingredients Lots of garlic (I used about 2 bulbs, but adjust to your own tolerance/taste) Noodles Onion Zucchini Ground beef or meatballs Chili oil (I use Lao Gan Ma) A little vegetable oil Light soy sauce Optional black bean sauce Cooking plan To a pot, add some salted water and cook your noodles as per the instructions on the package.</description>

      <description>So, yesterday I was craving some good &amp;lsquo;ol spaghetti. I usually go with a tomato sauce, but this time, I saw that I still had some parmigiano in my fridge. I simply couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist the urge to try something new, and ended up making this delicious carbonara. It may not be the healthiest, but it was definitely worth it in the end. I included a secret ingredient of miso paste in order to boost the umami content.</description>

      <description>After a long day of work, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to cook anything complicated. Whenever I have days like this, I like keeping it simple as well. Of course, simple does not necessarily mean bland, and this dish is both easy and flavorful. The name &amp;ldquo;Ants climbing a tree&amp;rdquo; stems from the fact that the small ingredients on top of the glass noodles look like ants climbing a tree.</description>

      <description>There were too many eggplants in my fridge, so I decided to do something about that. I could have made my melitzanosalata, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like that would be filling enough, and it was too cold outside to grill. That&amp;rsquo;s when I stumbled upon a dish I had never heard of before. Behold, the Egyptian dish &amp;ldquo;mesa&amp;rsquo;a&amp;rsquo;ah&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Ingredients Tomato paste (about 1 tsp) Eggplants (Like, 2 or something) Strained tomatoes (about 500 grams or something) Salt Dried coriander Cumin Lots of olive oil White onion Garlic (about 6 cloves?</description>

      <description>Every battle is won before it is fought - Sun Tzu&#xA;In my life, I have noticed that most of my failings are only recognized in hindsight. It is often easier to look back with an analytical mind than to analyze the situation on the fly. This is exactly why I mostly fall victim to my unwillingness to say no when I am put on the spot. From my experience, the best way to shift this bad habit is to analyze the course of action beforehand.</description>

      <description>Today, I share a very simple recipe for a burger sauce. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to make and a lot more interesting than your usual mayonaise or ketchup that you put on your burger. When making burgers, I suggest you assemble the following: your buns, a leave of lettuce, some fried onions, gherkins/pickles, your patty and lastly this burger sauce.&#xA;Ingredients Mayonaise (250 grams) Mustard (30 grams) 1 tbsp of white vinegar 0.</description>

      <description>You have to learn to say no to many good things if you want to say yes to many great things&#xA;Recently, I have found myself having trouble saying no to people. Of course, when push comes to shove, I know when to stand my ground when I strongly believe in something, but the main problem lies in saying no to good things. In order to explore this, I will take you on a journey of meditation where I explore this side of myself for the first time.</description>

      <description>Balance is not something you find but something you create&#xA;Sometimes, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting in a good groove. In those times, my studying routine works, my workout routine works, I&amp;rsquo;m being social and am taking care of myself and the people around me. Then, something happens that knocks me off-balance. This summer, it has been a wonderful vacation to Vietnam that saw me quickly adapt my way of living to this travelling lifestyle, but this sweeping force may also be something a little less enjoyable.</description>

      <description>Hiya, long time no see! It&amp;rsquo;s been - glances at notes - more than 100 days since I last posted something on Paul&amp;rsquo;s Particles. A lot has happened, but I&amp;rsquo;m finally starting to settle into my usual routine again. I&amp;rsquo;ve got some great content planned, but I thought I would start things off with a simple post sharing what my phone looks like. I actually hide all apps that are not on my home screen in order to avoid distractions from social media apps or apps that I just don&amp;rsquo;t use on a daily basis, meaning my home screen is like a best-of collection for my phone.</description>

      <description>So today, I tried to do something new with pork belly. Most of my recipes involving this ingredient are Chinese, and so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d spice things up a little by taking some more inspiration from the french kitchen. Be warned, this recipe is quite fatty, but otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to make and nutritious to boot.&#xA;Ingredients Butter Dried oregano Salt and Pepper Pork belly Lemon White onion Garlic Water Dark soy sauce (for color) Ginger (or ginger powder) High smoking point oil Serve with white rice.</description>

      <description>After having been on a vacation to Vietnam and Singapore for three weeks (hence the gap in posts, haha), this is one cuisine I have fallen in love with. I simply had to get a recipe to make this myself, and in my opinion, I am quite close to mimicking the taste of the curries I&amp;rsquo;ve had in Singapore. Be warned, this recipe can take up to 2 hours. I suggest serving this dish with (white) rice.</description>

      <description>At first, I was planning on making scones. Because of a lack of better moulds, I decided to use a muffin tray, and the rest is history. This recipe yields about 12 medium-sized scuffins.&#xA;Ingredients 500 grams of all-purpose flour 200 grams of granulated sugar About 10 grams of baking powder 2 eggs 250 grams of butter 200 grams of crème fraîche About 20 milliliters of milk About 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract A pinch of salt Optionally, toppings like milk chocolate, blueberries or caramel A muffin tray Baking plan Preheat an oven to 200 degrees Celsius.</description>

      <description>A good burrito recipe has been like the holy grail for me. I looove burritos, but I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get them to taste quite right. This recipe is finally close to the taste I have been searching for.&#xA;Ingredients Ground beef White onion Vegetable or olive oil. Lots of beans. I use kidney beans. They will be pasted. About 2 parts Salt, 1 part Pepper, 1 part Garlic powder, 4 parts Paprika powder, 8 parts Cumin.</description>

      <description>Falling down is an accident, staying down is a choice&#xA;When working on becoming the person you want to be, it is often in the stressful and doubtful situations that you find out your conviction is strong. You can tell alot about yourself and your growth as a person from how you deal with hardship, however small it may be.&#xA;It is good excercise to ask yourself what your instinctual reaction is when something goes wrong.</description>

      <description>Beauty exists only to relief us from ugliness&#xA;Often in live, I find myself feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m above the need for beauty. It can be seen as a virtue to look not at appearance but at what lies within. I agree with this, but only recently have I come around to realising that beauty has its place as well. A lack of elegance or beauty can be distracting. This distraction may take some effort to look through, ultimately draining (a slight amount of) energy.</description>

      <description>Meditation is conversation with the soul.&#xA;For quite some time now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to put more of my creative energy into my blog. To do this, I have tried to understand what makes me me by finding my creative voice. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid this question is too grand for me to answer in one go. In my life, I have meditated quite often, and this is just one of many other topics I will meditate on in my life.</description>

      <guid>https://example.org/recipes/egg-and-onion/</guid>
      <description>Today, we will be making OE. I&amp;rsquo;ll let you figure out what that means.&#xA;Ingredients Onions Eggs (also some pepper, salt and cooking oil) Cooking plan We will be using about one onion per one egg. For people that like the taste of onion, I suggest you let the onions sweat by using a medium-low heat, until the onions turn translucent. This takes about 10 minutes. For those of you that have time on their hands, let the onions caramelise on the same medium-low heat.</description>

      <description>Ok, so the description may have been a lie. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t barbecue because Dutch weather can be very unpredictable (Dutch struggles). Instead, I like to put stuff in the oven (like a true patriot). Therefore, this dish will be using our favorite inferno machine. The TTC (time to cook) is about an hour, so prepare it well in advance!&#xA;Ingredients White onions Shredded cheese (Gouda, because it melts well and because it&amp;rsquo;s Dutch) Butter Paprika powder Chopped parsley Dried thyme Dried oregano Aluminum foil Cooking plan Preheat an oven to 160 degrees Celsius.</description>

      <description>This is a lovely meaty dish that you can serve as a main course. With summer at its peak, you enjoy this dish on straight from the grill during a barbecue for example.&#xA;Marinade (extra virgin) olive oil Oregano Sweet paprika powder Thyme (optional) Bay leaves Juice from a lemon LOTS OF GARLIC Salt and pepper Chicken (cubed, which you&amp;rsquo;ll marinate) Cooking plan Mince the garlic. You should use enough that you can smell it.</description>

      <description>I love cooking Greek food. Something about the balance of oils, fresh herbs and grilled meats just really gets me going. But Greek food can be more than just gyros and souvlaki. To give our vegetarians some love, and in order to diversify your Greek palette, let me introduce you to this lovely dish called Melitzanosalata (eggplant salad).&#xA;Ingredients A few Eggplants Half a red onion (or a full shallot, if you want a more delicate flavour) Olive oil, preferably extra virgin.</description>

      <description>This recipe is a Paul-certified classic. It is easy to make (only about 30 minutes), and is quite filling for when you are having a busy week.&#xA;Ingredients Sausage (pork works well) Cooking oil A (small) tin of tomtato paste Yellow onion Garlic Bell peppers (different colors looks the nicest, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter for taste) Beef broth Garam masala (can sub for 5-spice) Pepper Dark soy sauce (for color and salt) Cooking plan First, cook your sausage in an oiled pan until golden brown.</description>

      <description>The recipe I referred to in my previous post. The flavour can best be described as má là, a Chinese term meaning numbing ( má 麻) and spicy ( là 辣). The aroma is citrusy and deep, and the flavour leaves you wanting more. I suggest you serve this with rice. This recipe takes about 45 minutes, but it is well worth it.&#xA;Ingredients Pork belly (without the rind) Black pepper About a tablespoon of red Sichuan peppercorns (less if you can&amp;rsquo;t stand the numbing effect) Five-spice powder High smoke point cooking oil (like vegetable oil) Star anise Onion Ginger As much pepper as you can handle (and don&amp;rsquo;t be a wimp!</description>

      <description>About 9 in 10 people in the world can read. Crazy, considering just 100 years ago this number barely exceeded 2 in 10. Talking about reading, I was doing some of that just now. I was looking into Sichuan cooking because I wanted to make something nice for diner, until I noticed something annoying. EVERY SINGLE COOKING BLOG PLACES THEIR RECIPE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE. Now, I&amp;rsquo;m no stranger to the internet and have done some research into SEO and all that, but this nuisance did spark some thoughts in me that I wanted to write down.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started getting into making soup recently. This is new territory for me, but I decided to give it a try after pondering what to do with the leftover chinese cabbage that had been living rent-free in my fridge for a too long. Behold! This soup was the result.&#xA;Ingredients Chinese Cabbage About 1 liter of chicken stock Eggs (about 3) White onion (can be omitted) Garlic Sesame oil Powdered or grated ginger Salt and (preferably white) pepper Scallion A little bit of cooking oil Cooking plan Chop up your onions, garlic and scallion (put aside the green for garnish).</description>

If you are looking for a sweet and unique taste, look no further than this recipe. I suggest serving this with white rice.&#xA;Ingredients For the meat Chicken breasts (whole, or already cubed) All purpose flour Cornstarch High smoke-point oil like peanut oil For the sauce A bunch of oranges (5 per kilo of chicken, more if you like it saucy) Alternatively, you can use orange juice instead of fresh oranges A bit of sugar (If it isn&amp;rsquo;t sweet enough already) Soy sauce Garlic powder Ginger (or ginger powder) Cornstarch (to thicken the sauce) Cooking plan Squeeze the oranges and strain the juice.</description>

      <description>So, I have struggled with a lack of motivation to write. Sometimes, I can be to perfectionistic to get anything done, while at other times I simply have to much going on in my head and I feel like I just can&amp;rsquo;t find the time to write. Whatever the reason may be, it&amp;rsquo;s unwarranted more often than not. This does not make the act of sitting down and simply writing any easier off course.</description>

      <description>Productive procrastination is the art of delaying the task you need to get done by doing other (often less important) tasks that need to be done. Now, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard many different takes on this habit, and have taken different stances through the years. Today, I will break down some of the benefits and problems. I will also discuss some alternative methods.&#xA;The good Momentum When doing work, you should aim to stay in motion.</description>

      <description>This recipe makes for a delicious and saucy beef dish. It takes some time to prepare, but is well worth it.&#xA;Ingredients Marinade Beef (I like using cheap steak for this, as the baking soda will tenderize it anyway) Shaoxing (cooking wine, sub with any rice wine) (Dark) soy sauce Oyster sauce Some white pepper A little cooking oil Baking soda (To tenderize the meat) Cornstarch (To keep the beef moist) Sauce Soy Sauce (light or dark) Sugar Oyster Sauce Shaoxing (To deglaze) A little cornstarch + water to thicken Veggies (for stir-fry) Garlic Ginger Spring onion Onion Bell pepper Dried chili pepper (you can remove this if you don&amp;rsquo;t like spicy food) Cooking plan Cut the beef into strips and mix it with the marinade (add the cornstarch at the end) Let it sit for at least 15 minutes, but preferably a few hours.</description>

      <description>Whenever I have rice left over, there are two things that immediately come to mind. Storing it to stir-fry it later, or turning it into a pudding if I have time to do so. This is the ultimate thoughtless recipe for when you want to keep your hands busy while listening to music for example.&#xA;Ingredients (Left over) rice Milk Sugar Vanilla extract (optional) Cooking plan Submerge the rice in milk.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog! This first post gives a basic overview of what this website is about, and why I started it.&#xA;Paul&amp;rsquo;s Particles This is a personal website containing everything I want to share with the world.
