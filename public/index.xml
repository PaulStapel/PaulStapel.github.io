      <description>This recipe makes for a delicious and saucy beef dish.

      <description>Whenever I have rice left over, there are two things that immediately come to mind. Storing it to stir-fry it later, or turning it into a pudding if I have time to do so. This is the ultimate thoughtless recipe for when you want to keep your hands busy while listening to music for example.&#xA;Ingredients (Left over) rice Milk Sugar Vanilla extract (optional) Cooking plan Submerge the rice in milk.</description>

      <description>Here you can find my current setup with regards to desk, hardware, software and the likes. I often find it useful to read what other people are using and how they stay organized, so in this post I will return the favor.&#xA;My workspace For my workspace, I sit at an Ikea Lagkapten desk, which I like to keep clean and minimal. On it, I have my laptop, a pen, a Harte Ikea LED-lamp and my (bullet) journal.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog! This first post gives a basic overview of what this website is about, and why I started it.&#xA;Paul&amp;rsquo;s Particles This is a personal website containing everything I want to share with the world. It is my aim to break these topics down to their fundamentals. In doing so, this website can become a repository of neatly contained packages (particles, if you will) of my knowledge and experience.</description>
