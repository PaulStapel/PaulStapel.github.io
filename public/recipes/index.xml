      <description>So today, I tried to do something new with pork belly. Most of my recipes involving this ingredient are Chinese, and so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d spice things up a little by taking some more inspiration from the french kitchen. Be warned, this recipe is quite fatty, but otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to make and nutritious to boot.&#xA;Ingredients Butter Dried oregano Salt and Pepper Pork belly Lemon White onion Garlic Water Dark soy sauce (for color) Ginger (or ginger powder) High smoking point oil Serve with white rice.</description>

      <description>After having been on a vacation to Vietnam and Singapore for three weeks (hence the gap in posts, haha), this is one cuisine I have fallen in love with. I simply had to get a recipe to make this myself, and in my opinion, I am quite close to mimicking the taste of the curries I&amp;rsquo;ve had in Singapore. Be warned, this recipe can take up to 2 hours. I suggest serving this dish with (white) rice.</description>

      <description>At first, I was planning on making scones. Because of a lack of better moulds, I decided to use a muffin tray, and the rest is history. This recipe yields about 12 medium-sized scuffins.&#xA;Ingredients 500 grams of all-purpose flour 200 grams of granulated sugar About 10 grams of baking powder 2 eggs 250 grams of butter 200 grams of crème fraîche About 20 milliliters of milk About 3 teaspoons of vanilla extract A pinch of salt Optionally, toppings like milk chocolate, blueberries or caramel A muffin tray Baking plan Preheat an oven to 200 degrees Celsius.</description>

      <description>A good burrito recipe has been like the holy grail for me. I looove burritos, but I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to get them to taste quite right. This recipe is finally close to the taste I have been searching for.&#xA;Ingredients Ground beef White onion Vegetable or olive oil. Lots of beans. I use kidney beans. They will be pasted. About 2 parts Salt, 1 part Pepper, 1 part Garlic powder, 4 parts Paprika powder, 8 parts Cumin.</description>

      <title>OE (Onion &amp; Eggs)</title>

      <description>Today, we will be making OE. I&amp;rsquo;ll let you figure out what that means.&#xA;Ingredients Onions Eggs (also some pepper, salt and cooking oil) Cooking plan We will be using about one onion per one egg. For people that like the taste of onion, I suggest you let the onions sweat by using a medium-low heat, until the onions turn translucent. This takes about 10 minutes. For those of you that have time on their hands, let the onions caramelise on the same medium-low heat.</description>

      <description>Ok, so the description may have been a lie. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t barbecue because Dutch weather can be very unpredictable (Dutch struggles). Instead, I like to put stuff in the oven (like a true patriot). Therefore, this dish will be using our favorite inferno machine. The TTC (time to cook) is about an hour, so prepare it well in advance!&#xA;Ingredients White onions Shredded cheese (Gouda, because it melts well and because it&amp;rsquo;s Dutch) Butter Paprika powder Chopped parsley Dried thyme Dried oregano Aluminum foil Cooking plan Preheat an oven to 160 degrees Celsius.</description>

      <description>This is a lovely meaty dish that you can serve as a main course. With summer at its peak, you enjoy this dish on straight from the grill during a barbecue for example.&#xA;Marinade (extra virgin) olive oil Oregano Sweet paprika powder Thyme (optional) Bay leaves Juice from a lemon LOTS OF GARLIC Salt and pepper Chicken (cubed, which you&amp;rsquo;ll marinate) Cooking plan Mince the garlic. You should use enough that you can smell it.</description>

      <description>I love cooking Greek food. Something about the balance of oils, fresh herbs and grilled meats just really gets me going. But Greek food can be more than just gyros and souvlaki. To give our vegetarians some love, and in order to diversify your Greek palette, let me introduce you to this lovely dish called Melitzanosalata (eggplant salad).&#xA;Ingredients A few Eggplants Half a red onion (or a full shallot, if you want a more delicate flavour) Olive oil, preferably extra virgin.</description>

      <description>This recipe is a Paul-certified classic. It is easy to make (only about 30 minutes), and is quite filling for when you are having a busy week.&#xA;Ingredients Sausage (pork works well) Cooking oil A (small) tin of tomtato paste Yellow onion Garlic Bell peppers (different colors looks the nicest, doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter for taste) Beef broth Garam masala (can sub for 5-spice) Pepper Dark soy sauce (for color and salt) Cooking plan First, cook your sausage in an oiled pan until golden brown.</description>

      <description>The recipe I referred to in my previous post. The flavour can best be described as má là, a Chinese term meaning numbing ( má 麻) and spicy ( là 辣). The aroma is citrusy and deep, and the flavour leaves you wanting more. I suggest you serve this with rice. This recipe takes about 45 minutes, but it is well worth it.&#xA;Ingredients Pork belly (without the rind) Black pepper About a tablespoon of red Sichuan peppercorns (less if you can&amp;rsquo;t stand the numbing effect) Five-spice powder High smoke point cooking oil (like vegetable oil) Star anise Onion Ginger As much pepper as you can handle (and don&amp;rsquo;t be a wimp!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve started getting into making soup recently. This is new territory for me, but I decided to give it a try after pondering what to do with the leftover chinese cabbage that had been living rent-free in my fridge for a too long. Behold! This soup was the result.&#xA;Ingredients Chinese Cabbage About 1 liter of chicken stock Eggs (about 3) White onion (can be omitted) Garlic Sesame oil Powdered or grated ginger Salt and (preferably white) pepper Scallion A little bit of cooking oil Cooking plan Chop up your onions, garlic and scallion (put aside the green for garnish).</description>

      <description>I have to admit, this is a guilty pleasure of mine. I don&amp;rsquo;t make this often, as it can take a bit long to make, but I always enjoy it when I do. If you are looking for a sweet and unique taste, look no further than this recipe. I suggest serving this with white rice.&#xA;Ingredients For the meat Chicken breasts (whole, or already cubed) All purpose flour Cornstarch High smoke-point oil like peanut oil For the sauce A bunch of oranges (5 per kilo of chicken, more if you like it saucy) Alternatively, you can use orange juice instead of fresh oranges A bit of sugar (If it isn&amp;rsquo;t sweet enough already) Soy sauce Garlic powder Ginger (or ginger powder) Cornstarch (to thicken the sauce) Cooking plan Squeeze the oranges and strain the juice.</description>

      <description>Whenever I have rice left over, there are two things that immediately come to mind. Storing it to stir-fry it later, or turning it into a pudding if I have time to do so. This is the ultimate thoughtless recipe for when you want to keep your hands busy while listening to music for example.&#xA;Ingredients (Left over) rice Milk Sugar Vanilla extract (optional) Cooking plan Submerge the rice in milk.</description>
