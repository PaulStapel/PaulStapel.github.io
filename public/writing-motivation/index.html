   <div class="singleBottom">
    
    <div class="singleContent"><p>So, I have struggled with a lack of motivation to write. Sometimes, I can be to perfectionistic to get anything done, while at other times I simply have to much going on in my head and I feel like I just can&rsquo;t find the time to write. Whatever the reason may be, it&rsquo;s unwarranted more often than not. This does not make the act of sitting down and simply writing any easier off course. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to share some of the ways I make writing (motivation) easier for myself.</p>
<h2 id="when-i-write">When I write</h2>
<p>I usually work well when I have a rhythm to my day. For writing, I find that I am more creative in the evenings, as my brain has been working for a while, and I can&rsquo;t really focus on demanding tasks like coding or doing maths anymore. By knowing the evening is a time for writing and being creative, I can enter my writing mode better. I usually force myself to write at least a paragraph per day in the evening. That way, I always keep up the good habit while not asking too much of myself. Usually, I enter the zone and keep writing, but I also allow myself to just not feel up to it and write only a little.</p>
<p>An added benefit of writing in the evening is that I can write down my recipes right after diner, so that the recipe is still fresh in my memory. Similarly, if you were to write about university, doings so immediately after coming home from the campus would be a way to channel the excitement of your day towards your writing. In general, I only write about things that excite me, so riding the wave of excitement is the best way to stay motivated. Whenever I learn something cool or when inspiration strikes me like hot lightening, I try to write it down as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-write-about">What I write about</h2>
<p>The topics you want to write about are also very important for motivation. I have a few rules when it comes to this:</p>
<p><strong>Rule 1: Don&rsquo;t make your writing your work (unless it IS your work)</strong>. When blogging as a hobby, like I am, it can often be difficult to start when you feel like you HAVE to get something finished before a certain time. Setting deadlines can be effective for work and such, but try not to force yourself too much when writing for fun; writing should be a laid-back experience. I also find that thinking about popularity of a blog too much can create some amount of anxiety, so only do this if you actually want to make this a job.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2: Don&rsquo;t (exclusively) make your work your writing</strong>. If you do something specific for work, like mathematics for example, chance is that you are thinking about this topic a lot. When wanting to unwind from a day of studying/working, you usually don&rsquo;t feel like having to write about those topics again. Although you would sometimes want to write about those things, you should also give yourself the freedom to pick up other topics you care about.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 3: Don&rsquo;t lock into one specific topic, give yourself the freedom to write whatever you want to write</strong>. I hear many influencers talk about how you should blog and write about some niche, such that you can become dominant in that category. Although I agree, I practice this advice in an unconventional manner. The way I see it, your personality is your niche, and anything you want to write about is in its purview. That way, I can write about anything I feel like. Having only one specific topic to write about can feel constraining, and in my experience it is a fast track to getting exhausted with your writing.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 4: Write about things you don&rsquo;t need to research from scratch (at the beginning at least)</strong>. Research can be exhausting, and it is often a turn-off for beginning writers. You should focus on creating the habit of writing first, to then extend it to doing research for your writing as well. This way, you can have a solid basis upon which to build this habit. With anything, making it as easy as possible to start writing should be the goal, as you can worry about the quality later. I call this method of creating habits scaffolding.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-use-to-write">What I use to write</h2>
<p>There are some tools that come with the trade, and I wanted to discuss how I go about writing with the tools I use. I usually like typing out my writing, as I&rsquo;m a fast typist, and this makes it so that I can jot down my thoughts when I think them. I absolutely love writing in markdown when it comes to this, as it is lightweight, while still giving you the possibility to customize. I do this editing in VScode, using an extension to spell check my work (code spell checker. I turn it off when actually coding).</p>
<p>What I need for writing is a place that doesn&rsquo;t feel all to cluttered, so that I have no distractions. This is why Word or Google docs never really work for me. Other great options I have used are Apple notes and Ulysses (paid, but cheap for students). The problem with Apple notes is that it is quite limited in what you can do (which is usually a good thing). Ulysses is great as it also uses markdown, but simple markdown files can be created anywhere, and I don&rsquo;t really see a reason to pay for a slightly fancier editor. If ever I need something more dedicated to writing, Ulysses would definitely be my go-to pick.</p>
<p>When it comes to research, I usually write simple apple notes to write down my ideas for new posts or other things. When I do research, I distill information by taking snap-shots, summarizing articles and linking ideas to eventually write a coherent piece. I like doing this digitally, as the search-features make it easier to find notes I want to use for my writing.</p>
<p>Finally, I listen to music when writing. Usually lofi hip-hop, but I am also partial to piano music when it comes to getting in a flow. When I don&rsquo;t feel motivated enough, it also helps me to listen to more peppy music with lyrics, so that I can sing along. This usually results in me being less focussed however, so I reserve this for when I really can&rsquo;t find motivation elsewhere :)</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-advice">Miscellaneous advice</h2>
<ul>
<li>When writing, I often encounter moments where I feel like stopping. When this happens, I first try to stare at a wall for a view seconds. Usually, I find whatever I&rsquo;m writing more interesting than a random wall, so I regain some of my focus. If this does not work and I get the urge to go do something else, I resort to taking a break with <a href="https://paulstapel.github.io/productive-procrastination/">productive procrastination</a>.</li>
<li>DRINK ENOUGH WATER WHILE WRITING</li>
<li>When writing, I find it helpful to reward myself by having some snacks on the table. This way, I make writing more enjoyable for myself. Besides, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449949/">chewing on food can help you stay focused</a>, making this tip a double-whammy.</li>
<li>Remember that you can always come back to something you wrote. Your first attempt does not have to be perfect! What&rsquo;s more, editing a finished piece is way easier than starting a piece from scratch. Perfect is the enemy of good, as Voltaire once said, so go easy on yourself.</li>
<li>Involve other people. Having other people join you on your writing journey can make it way easier to commit. Having one or more friends to blog alongside you can be a great boost to motivation, as you can share tips, progress and triumph with each other. At least having people you know read some of your writing can go a great way in motivating you, as you can get direct feedback on how your writing is affecting other people.</li>
